Binance,"Bitcoin Exchange Supply Hits Seven-Year Low Amid Increased Fund Inflows
According to PANews, recent data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin's supply on exchanges has reached its lowest point in seven years, dropping to 2.488 million BTC last Friday. Although the exchange reserves increased slightly over the weekend to 2.492 million BTC, this level remains the lowest since October 2018. CoinShares reported that Bitcoin funds saw an inflow of $3.2 billion for the week ending April 28. The combination of declining exchange balances and rising fund inflows suggests a new phase of accumulation may be underway. Notably, retail investors appear to have played a more significant role in the past week's price surge compared to previous weeks.

Binance,"Exploring the Future of Web3 AI Agents in Blockchain Ecosystems
According to PANews, the development of Web3 AI Agents is poised to transform blockchain ecosystems, with several key insights emerging about their potential applications. Firstly, the most native function of Web3 AI Agents may not be centered around 'transactions.' Despite the perception that DeFi trading agents represent the ultimate form of AI integration in crypto, the inherent ambiguity and hallucination processes of AI conflict with the precision and low tolerance for error required in trading scenarios. In the short term, Web3 AI Agents are likely to excel in 'data cleansing' and 'intent parsing,' rather than executing asset transactions with absolute accuracy. This includes cleaning on-chain and off-chain data to build effective information graphs and modeling user trading behavior for risk preference analysis, thereby customizing smart money trading decision assistants. Secondly, the need for A2A communication protocol functionality in Web3 AI Agents may surpass that of MCP. While MCP calls rely on mature functional API interfaces, a developed agent application ecosystem can effectively address data silo issues through MCP. However, if the application landscape is immature, MCP's standardized interfaces lack utility. In contrast, the A2A protocol can create an incremental agent market, fostering specialized agents such as on-chain data analysis agents, smart contract audit agents, and MEV opportunity capture agents. The built-in agent capability registry and P2P messaging network within A2A will enhance the adaptability and complex interaction value of these agents, overcoming the limitations of language interaction at the MCP protocol level. Thirdly, the demand for infrastructure construction in Web3 AI Agents exceeds the need for application deployment. While Web2 AI prioritizes practical value, Web3 AI Agents require a complete ecosystem, necessitating the development of foundational infrastructure such as unified data layers, Oracle layers, intent execution layers, and decentralized consensus layers. Rather than competing directly with Web2 at the application level, building differentiated infrastructure with Web3 advantages is crucial. Although application deployment may lag behind Web2 AI, constructing decentralized consensus networks for A2A operations and interactive operation standards for MCP aligns with blockchain's native characteristics, making infrastructure development equally urgent. Lastly, a shift from Crypto Native to AI Native thinking is essential. Reflecting on the history of crypto, the adherence to a 'decentralization' framework has spawned diverse tracks and innovation waves. In the future AI + Crypto domain, the focus may shift towards 'AI autonomy.' Whether agentic or robotic, the pursuit of a new AI-centric paradigm framework is vital, such as AI agent clusters with self-funding management capabilities, self-upgrading smart contract templates based on network feedback, and DAO governance frameworks dynamically optimized by community contributions. Ultimately, moving beyond simple tool application thinking to enable AI-driven evolution systems is the key to progress.",04-28-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin Price News: Bitcoin’s Upside May Stall at $100K Despite $3B in ETF Inflows
High Bitcoin ETF inflows fuel short-term price gains but resistance looms near key psychological levelsBitcoin (BTC) has shown strong recovery momentum, climbing above $94,500, but analysts caution that significant resistance around $100,000 could cap further gains despite robust ETF inflows.Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge to $3 Billion, But Do They Signal a Top?Bitcoin’s rally from $74,400 to current levels was supported by renewed investor interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, which recorded $3.06 billion in net weekly inflows — the largest since December 2025, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data.Historically, large ETF inflows have shown mixed signals regarding Bitcoin price tops:In March 2024, inflows over $1 billion coincided with Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs around $73,300, followed by corrections.Similarly, June 2024 inflows preceded a rally from $67,000 to $72,000, before a sharp 25% correction.However, November 2024 inflows of $3.38 billion led to Bitcoin breaking the $100,000 mark without an immediate reversal, suggesting that high inflows do not always precede a market top.Market analytics firm FalconX used a Vector Autoregression model to show that Bitcoin ETF inflows have short-term predictive power for price increases but do not reliably signal major reversals. Bitcoin Faces Resistance at $95K to $100K RangeBitcoin’s 27% rally from recent lows has flipped critical support levels, including the:50-day SMA at $85,100,100-day SMA at $90,570,and 200-day SMA at $89,300.Currently, Bitcoin consolidates under the $95,000 resistance zone, with notable seller interest between $97,000 and $100,000, according to monitoring resource CoinGlass.Popular crypto analyst AlphaBTC noted:""The $95,000 level has contained Bitcoin's price over the past few days. A breakout is possible, but reaching $100K may trigger a larger pullback.""Similarly, Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan expressed skepticism about Bitcoin sustaining a move above $95,000 without stronger catalysts.Trading firm QCP Capital also warned that while the sentiment remains positive, Bitcoin lacks a clear catalyst to propel it decisively beyond the psychological $100,000 threshold.Short-Term Strength, Medium-Term CautionWhile Bitcoin ETF inflows continue to provide a strong foundation for bullish momentum, analysts caution that price movements toward $100,000 could face significant liquidity-driven resistance.The coming weeks could determine whether Bitcoin’s rally extends into new all-time highs or whether a consolidation phase will set in, as investors weigh macroeconomic developments and further ETF flows, according to Cointelegraph.",04-28-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin News Today: Global Central Bank Gold Rush Could Ignite Bitcoin Price to New All-Time Highs
Shifting Treasury and Gold Trends Signal a Favorable Macro Backdrop for BitcoinBitcoin (BTC) may be poised for a major price breakout as global financial trends increasingly mirror conditions seen during the 2020–2021 bull run, analysts suggest.Recent data highlights major shifts in global asset allocation, including a historic surge in US Treasury inflows, reduced foreign central bank exposure to Treasurys, and an accelerated accumulation of gold reserves — factors that historically correlate with strong Bitcoin rallies.Central Banks Slash Treasury Holdings, Turn to GoldAccording to the latest data:US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in inflows last week, the highest since March 2023.30-year Treasury yields dropped 30 basis points from April peaks, signaling rising bond demand.Foreign central banks cut their US Treasury holdings to 23% of outstanding US government debt — a 22-year low.Meanwhile, gold’s share of global central bank reserves hit 18%, the highest in 26 years.This shift, fueled partly by ongoing US-China tariff tensions, signals a gradual de-dollarization trend, with central banks seeking alternatives to US debt instruments.Historical Parallels: Bitcoin’s 2020 Bull RunSimilar macroeconomic patterns fueled Bitcoin’s historic rally during the pandemic:In 2020, spikes in US Treasury inflows coincided with Bitcoin’s rise from $9,000 to $60,000.Gold’s share of global reserves increased by 14.5% over 18 months.Investors sought alternative stores of value amid concerns over traditional monetary systems.Today’s bond and gold market dynamics suggest similar conditions are emerging, setting the stage for a potential Bitcoin breakout in 2025.Institutional Demand Dominates Bitcoin’s Current RallyAnalysts from Capital Flows and Bitwise highlight that Bitcoin’s latest price surge, which pushed BTC above $94,000, is largely institution-driven rather than retail-led:Google search interest for “Bitcoin” remains near long-term lows, according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley.Corporate treasuries, asset managers, and even sovereign entities are increasingly driving Bitcoin demand.Previous cycles heavily correlated Bitcoin price movements with retail search volume; this shift suggests a maturing market dynamic.Data from SEMrush shows that in earlier cycles, Bitcoin search volumes had a 91% correlation with price movements, a trend that appears to have diverged in 2025.Risks Remain: Impact of a Potential RecessionDespite bullish signals, some caution remains:A global recession could derail Bitcoin’s rally if investors shift toward cash and traditional safe havens like US Treasurys instead of riskier assets.Liquidity conditions and investor sentiment in coming quarters will be critical for sustaining Bitcoin’s upward momentum.Nonetheless, the combination of easing Treasury yields, central bank gold accumulation, and increasing institutional adoption presents a compelling macro backdrop for Bitcoin’s next potential move toward new all-time highs, according to Cointelegraph.",04-28-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Could Hit $210K in 2025, Says Presto Research Chief
Peter Chung Highlights Bitcoin’s Dual Role as Both Risk Asset and Digital GoldPeter Chung, head of research at quantitative trading firm Presto, has reiterated his bullish forecast that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $210,000 by the end of 2025, citing growing institutional adoption and global liquidity expansion as primary catalysts.In an interview with CNBC on April 28, Chung acknowledged that 2025’s market conditions have been challenging but characterized recent corrections as a “healthy adjustment” that strengthens Bitcoin’s foundation as a mainstream financial asset.Bitcoin's Dual Identity: Risk-On Asset and Digital GoldChung emphasized Bitcoin’s unique dual behavior:In favorable market environments, Bitcoin acts as a risk-on asset, driven by network effects and user adoption.During financial instability, Bitcoin increasingly behaves like digital gold, serving as a safe-haven asset, particularly when confidence in the U.S. dollar system falters.“These moments are rare,” Chung noted, pointing to examples like the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 and the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in 2023 where Bitcoin's safe-haven properties became evident.Despite lagging gold during recent turbulence, Chung believes Bitcoin could catch up and outperform traditional safe-haven assets by the end of 2025.Institutional Adoption Accelerates Bitcoin’s GrowthSupporting Chung’s outlook, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley observed that Bitcoin’s rise to around $94,000 has occurred with limited retail investor participation. Google search trends for ""Bitcoin"" remain near historical lows, suggesting that the current rally is primarily driven by:Institutional investorsFinancial advisersCorporationsSovereign entitiesCorporate treasuries already hold nearly $65 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data.Further reinforcing the bullish sentiment, analysts from Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI recently stated that institutional demand via Bitcoin ETFs and macroeconomic hedging strategies could cause Bitcoin’s price to more than double in 2025.Ethereum Outlook Remains StrongChung also reaffirmed Presto’s positive outlook for Ethereum (ETH), citing ongoing network improvements and valuation models based on the ETH-to-BTC ratio, signaling continued confidence in Ethereum's role within the crypto ecosystem, according to Cointelegraph.",04-28-2025

Binance,"PancakeSwap in 2025: Can BNB Chain’s Flagship DEX Lead DeFi’s Next Growth Cycle?
PancakeSwap is once again at the forefront of decentralized finance (DeFi) as the market enters a renewed growth cycle in 2025. Built on BNB Chain, the protocol has evolved far beyond its roots as a yield-farming hotspot during DeFi Summer. Today, PancakeSwap is positioning itself as a multichain DeFi powerhouse—offering liquidity solutions, AI-powered trading features, and even integration with real-world assets (RWAs).With Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing $2 billion and daily trading volume consistently above $2.5 billion, PancakeSwap is capitalizing on rising regulatory clarity, growing institutional interest, and next-gen infrastructure like zkSync and AI-enhanced liquidity routing.PancakeSwap 2025 RoadMap: Growth, Metrics & Market PositionPancakeSwap’s transformation is reflected in its 2025 metrics:TVL: As of January 2025, PancakeSwap boasts $1.98 billion in total value locked, reflecting strong liquidity health and market confidence.Trading Volume: The platform recorded $78.45 billion in monthly trading volume and an average daily volume of $2.53 billion.Active Users: January also saw 2.35 million unique traders and 2.1 million onsite users—strong indicators of sticky engagement.Meanwhile, CAKE, the platform’s native token, posted a notable rebound. On March 21, 2025, it surged to $2.83 before settling at $2.71—marking a 67.45% weekly gain and outperforming other DEX tokens.Key DeFi Trends PancakeSwap Is Embracing in 20251.

Binance,"Bitcoin Shows Strong Correlation with Gold Amid Market Fluctuations
According to Odaily, CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten has observed that Bitcoin has decreased by approximately 1.5% since December 31 of last year. This performance is situated between gold, which has risen by 24%, and the Nasdaq 100 index, which has fallen by over 7%. Consequently, the notion of Bitcoin as either a leveraged tech stock or digital gold leans slightly towards the digital gold perspective. Analyzing the 30-day moving average correlation coefficient, Bitcoin currently shows a stronger correlation with gold, reaching 0.70, compared to a weaker correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index at 0.53. This indicates that Bitcoin's performance aligns more closely with gold rather than tech stocks. The correlation coefficient ranges from 1 (strong positive correlation) to -1 (strong negative correlation). Last week, Bitcoin's price increased by 10%, marking its strongest performance since the significant price surge following U.S. President Donald Trump's election victory on November 17 of last year.

""If these inflows persist, it could validate the current price move as the beginning of a broader upward trend rather than a temporary recovery.""The rise in short-term trading activity comes as Bitcoin recently climbed above $95,000 before briefly retracing below $94,000, following weeks of consolidation and macroeconomic uncertainty.Broader Market ContextThe surge in speculative demand aligns with a broader renewal of bullish sentiment across the digital asset sector. Bitcoin inflows into investment products hit $3.18 billion last week, while Ethereum saw its first net inflows after eight weeks of outflows, according to separate fund flow data.IntoTheBlock emphasized that the continuation of fund inflows will be critical to determine whether Bitcoin can sustain a new bullish cycle heading into the mid-year period.",04-28-2025

Analysts emphasized that sectors reliant on debt financing — such as real estate, consumer discretionary, and industrial manufacturing — are particularly vulnerable.""The effects of aggressive rate hikes are still unfolding, and many firms are now confronting severe financing pressures,"" Zaye Capital Markets noted.Credit markets have tightened significantly over the past 18 months, reducing access to affordable capital for mid-sized and leveraged firms.Historical ComparisonThe last time U.S. bankruptcies reached similar levels was during the post-2008 financial crisis period, when corporate defaults peaked amid the fallout from the global recession.The rise in bankruptcies today underscores how elevated borrowing costs and weaker economic growth are stressing corporate balance sheets, even as broader equity markets show signs of resilience.Outlook for 2025Analysts warn that unless interest rates fall sharply or credit conditions ease, bankruptcy rates may continue climbing through 2025, particularly in sectors exposed to debt refinancing risks.The trend could also influence broader market sentiment, especially in credit and bond markets, as investors reassess default risk among lower-rated issuers.",04-28-2025

Warsh argues that the Fed has overstepped certain long-standing central bank principles and practices. The Federal Reserve's expanding role in government economic policy has led to systemic errors in macroeconomic policy, according to Warsh.

Binance,"Ethereum Improvement Proposal Aims to Boost Transaction Capacity
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist has introduced a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-9698) that could significantly increase the Ethereum mainnet's gas limit, potentially enhancing its transaction capacity. The proposal, unveiled on April 27, suggests a ""deterministic gas limit growth schedule"" starting at epoch 369017, approximately around June 1, 2025. This schedule would gradually increase the gas limit by a factor of 10 over two years, culminating in a final tenfold increase. Feist, known for the blockchain's ""danksharding"" data storage solution, emphasized that Ethereum clients would need to vote on the proposal for it to be implemented. He stated that the EIP aims to introduce a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, promoting a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory aligned with advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency. Currently, Ethereum can reach up to 20 transactions per second (TPS) in blocks dominated by simple transactions. The proposed 100x gas limit increase could theoretically boost Ethereum's TPS to 2,000, positioning it to compete with platforms like Solana, which processes between 800 to 1,050 TPS and has a theoretical TPS of 65,000. The proposal would expand the current gas limit from 36 million to 3.6 billion, potentially accommodating around 6,000 transactions in Ethereum blocks. This initiative follows a recent decision by Ethereum validators to raise the gas limit from 30 million to 36 million in February. The last adjustment to Ethereum's gas limit occurred in August 2021 during the London hard fork, which doubled the limit from 15 million to 30 million. Feist acknowledged that a rapid increase in the gas limit might stress less-optimized nodes and extend block propagation times. However, he noted that the exponential schedule with gradual increments per epoch provides node operators and developers ample time to adapt and optimize. EIP-9698 represents the Ethereum community's latest effort to enhance scalability at the base layer, following a focus on scaling through layer 2 solutions in recent years. Critics of Ethereum's layer-2 strategy argue that it has fragmented the ecosystem into several siloed chains with limited interoperability, resulting in a suboptimal user experience. Additionally, Ethereum developers are exploring a fourfold increase in the gas limit in the Fusaka hard fork under EIP-9678, which is anticipated to go online in late 2025. Meanwhile, the next major Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, is scheduled for deployment on the mainnet in May 2025.",04-28-2025

Binance,"Michael Saylor's Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Sparks Debate on Market Impact
According to Cointelegraph, Michael Saylor's approach to Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition is likened to ""synthetically halving Bitcoin"" by purchasing a significant portion of the newly minted supply from miners each month. This strategy, as explained by BTC analyst and author Adam Livingston, involves acquiring more than half of the monthly Bitcoin production, which currently stands at approximately 13,500 BTC. Over the past six months, Saylor's firm has acquired 379,800 BTC, averaging around 2,087 BTC per day, surpassing the daily output of miners. Livingston suggests that as Bitcoin becomes scarcer, access to it will demand a premium, and borrowing against Bitcoin will become a luxury reserved for nation-states and large corporations. He further predicts that Strategy will control the bottleneck, influencing BTC's global cost of capital, which will no longer be determined by the market but by Strategy's policies. This anticipated supply crunch could lead to significantly higher BTC prices if the firm maintains its acquisition pace amid growing demand from institutional and retail investors. The Bitcoin miner reserve, which tracks the total BTC held in miner wallets, continues to decline, indicating a shift in holdings towards institutions like Strategy. Cypherpunk and Blockstream CEO Adam Back has predicted that Strategy and similar institutions adopting a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan could propel BTC's market capitalization to $200 trillion. Back describes these companies as exploiting the gap between Bitcoin's future potential and the current fiat system. However, critics caution that Strategy's debt-based BTC acquisition approach could pose financial risks if a prolonged bear market occurs. They also warn of systemic risks due to the high concentration of Bitcoin held by a single entity. Despite these concerns, Bitcoin advocate and author Saifedean Ammous argues that Strategy's concentration of BTC does not threaten the protocol. Ammous believes that institutions like BlackRock and Strategy cannot engineer a hard fork to increase Bitcoin's maximum supply, as it would devalue their holdings, ultimately affecting shareholders who have the power to divest.",04-27-2025

Binance,"Ethereum Faces Challenges Amid Proposed Fee Structure Changes
According to Cointelegraph, two prominent members of the Ethereum community, Kevin Owocki and Devansh Mehta, have put forward a proposal for a dynamic fee structure aimed at balancing revenue generation for application builders with fairness in fee extraction. The proposal, introduced on April 27, suggests a simple equation utilizing a square root function to proportionally reduce the percentage of fees as the funding capital allocated to a project increases. This approach is designed to provide higher returns for smaller funding amounts, making it worthwhile to build mechanisms for smaller pools. For instance, if a funding pool amounts to $170,000, the square root function would result in a 7% fee, equating to $13,038.4 as overhead. The proposal also includes a cap on fees at 1% once a project's funding pool surpasses $10 million, ensuring that smaller app builders can develop decentralized applications without excessive fees while promoting growth by capping fees as developers scale their applications. Owocki and Mehta's proposal highlights the ongoing discussions within the Ethereum community about reforming fee structures and value accrual mechanisms to maintain the network's economic viability in the face of increasing competition. In 2024, the Solana ecosystem attracted more developers than Ethereum, with 7,625 new developers compared to Ethereum's 6,456. Despite this, Ethereum remains the leading ecosystem for developer talent, although its dominance is now being challenged. Solana has emerged as the second choice for decentralized application developers, closing the gap with Ethereum. Meanwhile, onchain analytics firm Santiment reported that Ethereum fees reached a five-year low in April 2025 due to decreased activity on the Ethereum base layer, attributed to reduced demand for smart contract operations such as decentralized finance. This decline in demand has led many institutions to scale back their Ether (ETH) holdings or sell portions of their investments, as investor sentiment toward the pioneering smart-contract platform continues to weaken without any clear catalysts for a turnaround.",04-27-2025

She likened the current environment to the game ""the floor is lava,"" where participants must avoid direct contact — symbolizing firms’ efforts to avoid handling crypto assets amid regulatory uncertainty.Navigating Regulatory UncertaintyPeirce explained that SEC registrants — including brokers and alternative trading systems (ATS) — are moving cautiously to avoid regulatory missteps, often refraining from directly managing or custodying cryptocurrencies.Key challenges cited include:Unclear classification of which crypto assets qualify as securitiesLack of clarity around qualified custodians for digital assetsRegulatory uncertainty surrounding staking and governance activitiesPeirce warned that the cautious approach hampers the development of a robust and innovative crypto market.Calls for Practical Custody SolutionsSEC Commissioner Mark Uyada echoed these concerns, emphasizing the need to expand custodial options for firms dealing with digital assets.

Binance,"Bitcoin Unit Proposal Sparks Debate Over Simplification
According to PANews, a proposal by core developer and Synonym CEO John Carvalho has stirred controversy within the Bitcoin community. As the community focuses on enhancing user experience, developing custody solutions, lobbying for regulation, and attracting institutions, Carvalho has suggested a simpler approach: abolishing the 'satoshi' unit and removing decimal points to lower the cognitive barrier for newcomers. In a BIP proposal from December 2024, Carvalho advocated for redefining the 100 million satoshis that make up one Bitcoin as simply 'Bitcoin.' For instance, a transaction currently displayed as 0.00010000 BTC would appear as 10,000 BTC under the new system, fundamentally altering the perception of 'Bitcoin millionaires.' This proposal quickly sparked debate. Critics mockingly referred to the 'pizza theory,' suggesting that if each slice of pizza were called a 'whole,' one would need to order eight 'wholes' to satisfy their needs, highlighting the absurdity of unit inflation. Many community members are concerned that expanding the total from 21 million to 2.1 trillion units could undermine the narrative of Bitcoin's scarcity. Despite the opposition, Carvalho's proposal may be gaining traction. On April 25, he posted on the X platform, stating, ""Though still a minority, more people are beginning to accept the idea of calling Bitcoin's smallest unit 'Bitcoin' and eliminating decimal points.""",04-27-2025

Blockchain Adoption Expected to Reshape Property Investment Over the Next DecadeThe value of tokenized real estate could exceed $4 trillion by 2035, according to a new report from the Deloitte Center for Financial Services. The forecast reflects the growing adoption of blockchain technology in the real estate sector and a broader transformation in property ownership models.The report, published on April 24, estimates that tokenized real estate could grow from less than $300 billion in 2024 to over $4 trillion within a decade, driven by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 27%.Drivers Behind the GrowthAccording to the report, the expected surge is fueled by both technological innovation and structural shifts in the real estate market:The impact of remote work trends, climate risk, and digitization is reshaping the fundamentals of property investment.Traditional office spaces are being repurposed into AI data centers, logistics hubs, and energy-efficient residential communities, noted Chris Yin, co-founder of Plume Network, a blockchain built for real-world assets (RWAs).Tokenization enables investors to gain customizable, programmable exposure to these evolving asset types, offering a way to diversify and target specific real estate sectors more efficiently.Macro Trends Supporting TokenizationThe report also notes that geopolitical uncertainty, including concerns about U.S. import tariffs under President Donald Trump, has boosted interest in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.According to Juan Pellicer, senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, RWAs and stablecoins have increasingly become safe-haven assets during periods of global trade tension.Tokenized gold volumes surpassed $1 billion in daily trading on April 10, the highest level since the U.S. banking crisis of March 2023.Regulatory OutlookWhile regulation remains a challenge, industry participants are optimistic that growing adoption will drive clearer legal frameworks.""While regulation is a hurdle, regulation follows usage,"" said Chris Yin, comparing tokenization's trajectory to the early growth of companies like Uber.However, not everyone is convinced that real estate is the ideal initial focus for tokenization efforts. Speaking at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Securitize COO Michael Sonnenshein argued that the blockchain economy currently demands more liquid assets rather than illiquid sectors like real estate.""Efficiencies can be unlocked in real estate, but the current on-chain economy is looking for liquidity,"" Sonnenshein said.Despite differing opinions, Deloitte’s projections suggest that tokenized real estate could emerge as a major asset class by 2035, offering a new approach to property investment through the integration of blockchain technology, fractional ownership, and global market access, according to Cointelegraph.",04-26-2025
Binance,"DeFi Development Corp Seeks $1 Billion to Expand Solana Treasury and Investments
Nasdaq-Listed Firm Shifts Focus to Crypto After Leadership OverhaulDeFi Development Corp — formerly known as Janover — has filed a Form S-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announcing its intention to raise over $1 billion to invest in Solana (SOL) and cover general corporate expenses.The move signals a major strategic pivot by the Nasdaq-listed company, which transitioned from a real estate financing platform to a crypto-focused enterprise following a leadership change earlier this month.Solana Treasury Strategy Echoes Bitcoin Treasury ModelsAccording to the SEC filing, DeFi Development plans to use proceeds from the offering to purchase Solana tokens, aiming to accumulate a substantial on-chain treasury reserve. The company cited staking rewards and potential price appreciation as the primary motivations behind the investment strategy, although it also cautioned that volatility could result in significant valuation fluctuations.""Solana does not pay interest, but staking rewards can be earned,"" the filing states. ""The ability to generate a return... will depend on whether there is appreciation in the value of Solana.""The firm’s board approved the Solana treasury policy on April 4, authorizing long-term accumulation and the establishment of Solana validators to stake treasury assets. Parker White, DeFi Development’s Chief Investment Officer and former Kraken executive, currently operates a Solana validator managing $75 million in delegated stake.The model closely mirrors the public-market treasury approach made famous by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has amassed more than 538,200 Bitcoin as of April 2025.Regulatory Risks Highlighted in SEC FilingDespite its ambitious plans, DeFi Development acknowledged significant regulatory risks tied to crypto asset investments. The company warned that unclear regulatory frameworks could impact the price of Solana and the market value of its common stock.One key concern outlined in the filing is the possibility that Solana could be reclassified as a security under U.S. law, potentially subjecting the firm to investment company regulations under the Investment Company Act of 1940.""We may be subject to regulatory developments related to crypto assets, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations,"" the filing noted.Share Price Impact and Industry ReactionDeFi Development’s crypto-focused pivot has had a positive short-term impact on its share price. Following the company’s April 22 announcement that it had added $11.5 million worth of Solana to its treasury, its stock price rose by over 12%.Industry figures have praised the move. Chris Chung, founder of Solana-based platform Titan, described it as ""groundbreaking"" and suggested more traditional businesses may follow suit as digital assets become more widely adopted in mainstream finance, according to Cointelegraph.",04-26-2025

According to PANews, a recent report by Citibank forecasts that the total supply of stablecoins could reach $1.6 trillion by 2030 under a baseline scenario, and up to $3.7 trillion in an optimistic scenario. Analysts suggest that if Citigroup's predictions materialize and regulatory momentum under U.S. President Donald Trump's policies continues, Bitcoin may enter a price discovery phase. Historically, the growth of stablecoins has been linked to Bitcoin's price appreciation, with a 6.7-fold increase in stablecoins potentially translating to a 3 to 5-fold increase in Bitcoin's value. This could see Bitcoin's price reaching $285,000 by 2030, with a more optimistic upper limit nearing $475,000 per coin. Even under conservative assumptions, where only 25% of stablecoin growth shifts to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency could still see a 200% to 250% increase from current levels, with prices projected to rise to between $190,000 and $237,500 by 2030.",04-26-2025

Binance,"Swiss National Bank Rejects Bitcoin Reserve Proposal Amid Economic Uncertainty
According to Cointelegraph, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has dismissed calls to incorporate Bitcoin into its reserves, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. SNB Chairman Martin Schlegel stated during a shareholder meeting in Bern that cryptocurrencies do not currently meet the requirements for the bank's currency reserves. This stance comes amid increasing pressure from the local crypto industry to include Bitcoin (BTC) in the central bank's reserves. Luzius Meisser, a board member of cryptocurrency broker Bitcoin Suisse, argued that holding Bitcoin is sensible as the world transitions to a multipolar order, especially given the weakening of the dollar and the euro. Schlegel has previously expressed concerns about Bitcoin's stability, liquidity, and security, reiterating his reluctance to make it a reserve asset for Switzerland. On December 31, 2024, the Swiss Federal Chancellery launched a proposal to constitutionally mandate the SNB to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The initiative requires 100,000 signatures to trigger a referendum. The proposal aims to amend Article 99 of the constitution, which currently mandates the SNB to hold part of its reserves in gold. If successful, the amendment would include Bitcoin alongside gold. The campaign, supported by the Swiss Bitcoin nonprofit think tank 2B4CH, seeks to reduce the central bank's reliance on foreign currency holdings, primarily in US dollars and euros. Meisser emphasized that Bitcoin offers a hedge against political influence, as it cannot be inflated through deficit spending. Yves Bennaïm, founder and chairman of 2B4CH, suggested that allocating 1-2% of the SNB's nearly 1 trillion francs in reserves to Bitcoin could be beneficial. Switzerland remains a prominent hub for blockchain enterprises, with its ""Crypto Valley"" in Zug being the birthplace of Ethereum. The region continues to foster crypto initiatives, including the recent rollout of Bitcoin-based payments by global grocery giant Spar in a Swiss city.

According to Cointelegraph, the crypto industry is anticipating a significant change in regulatory approach following Paul Atkins' appointment as the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 21, 2025. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his deregulatory stance, succeeds Gary Gensler, whose tenure was marked by a stringent approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This leadership change is expected to influence innovation, investment, and regulatory clarity in the digital asset sector. Chris Perkins, president of CoinFund, expressed optimism about the new SEC leadership during a discussion with Savannah Fortis on Byte-Sized Insight. Perkins anticipates a decrease in regulatory uncertainty, which he believes will foster a more favorable environment for investors and developers in the crypto space. He noted that the previous administration's regulatory policies created a climate of apprehension among investors and developers, who were concerned about reputational and regulatory risks. Perkins suggested that the new regulatory climate could stimulate growth by reducing personal liability and attracting institutional capital and developers, potentially ushering in a 'golden age' for venture and value creation. Katherine Dowling, general counsel and chief commercial officer at Bitwise Asset Management, echoed this sentiment, noting that the regulatory atmosphere has already begun to shift. She observed a surge in legal activities, with some cases being dismissed or dropped, not due to a lack of regulation, but because there is a need to better define digital assets. Dowling emphasized that the focus is on achieving clarity rather than deregulation, suggesting a move towards a more structured understanding of digital assets and their regulation. James Gernetzke, chief financial officer of Bitcoin and crypto wallet Exodus, highlighted the potential benefits of engaging with regulators on a reasonable basis. He anticipates a return to more typical timelines for initial public offerings (IPOs) and access to capital markets, predicting an IPO surge towards the end of the year.

Top Interest of the Week$MAGIC serves as the governance token for Treasure, a decentralized gaming console platform operating on Arbitrum. The recent surge in this token's value was fueled by the announcement of the team's integration of advanced AI agents capable of playing games. These bots will engage on social media, participate in gaming, accumulate rewards, and even conduct trades through a single, tradable NFT asset. The overarching aim is to create a synergy between AI, gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). New Kind of Network ($NKN) is a cryptocurrency initiative focused on constructing a decentralized internet by enabling bandwidth sharing. In contrast to conventional internet service providers, NKN allows users to connect directly with one another and earn tokens for sharing their unused internet capacity. Its blockchain-based protocol aspires to deliver a quicker and more accessible internet experience. Additionally, NKN is investigating innovative applications, such as secure data relay for decentralized AI inference, in line with the anticipated AI-blockchain convergence of 2025.Turbo represents the intersection of artificial intelligence, speed, and humour. It was launched in a remarkable 69 hours with a mere $69 budget, and it quickly gained notoriety as a meme coin without any developer promotion or influencer support—just a blend of absurdity and rapid growth. The community embraced Turbo's meme-centric approach, sustaining its momentum throughout crypto Twitter. The value of the memecoin endorsed by President Trump, $TRUMP, saw a significant increase on Wednesday, jumping 58% in just one hour, reaching close to the $15 mark for the first time since March. This surge was triggered by the announcement that top token holders would be invited to an exclusive dinner with Trump at his golf club near Washington, D.C., on May 22, where he will share insights on the future of cryptocurrency in a personal setting.Overall MarketSource: TradingViewThe above chart is the BTC price in the daily candle chart at a log scale.In our analysis last week, we maintained a neutral short-term outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) while adopting a bearish perspective for the next 6 to 12 months. Our research indicated strong resistance in the $91,000 range, where BTC was likely to face selling pressure. Although the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggested an imminent breakout, the direction remained uncertain. Ultimately, the market continued its prior trend following a period of tight range consolidation, underscoring the prevailing volatility.On Monday, the U.S. equity market extended its selloff from the previous week, with the S&P 500 declining by 3% intraday. Despite this downturn, BTC demonstrated remarkable resilience against the U.S. dollar, buoyed in part by the dollar’s weakening. This divergence in performance suggests that BTC is increasingly being perceived as a safe haven asset, akin to gold, particularly during periods of heightened market uncertainty.The shift in market sentiment was further catalyzed by remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent on Tuesday, who indicated that the ongoing tariff conflict with China is unsustainable. Additionally, President Trump’s statement that tariffs on China would be ""reduced significantly"" but not eliminated was interpreted as a potential de-escalation signal. This news triggered a bullish reversal in risk assets, propelling BTC above the $91,000 resistance level and transforming it into a support zone. The price surged to nearly $95,000, driven by short position liquidations and fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors.However, the bullish momentum has since waned, as the market lacks further clarity on U.S.-China trade relations. While the U.S. administration’s remarks spurred significant capital inflows into BTC ETFs, boosting the price temporarily, our desk believes this rally may be short-lived without concrete progress on tariff reductions. Currently, BTC is trading above our highlighted support range of $91,000 to $92,000. Based on our technical analysis, BTC may enter a consolidation phase, potentially retesting the $88,000 level before any sustained upward movement. The recent price action, marked by a breakout above $91,000, could signal further gains if BTC holds above this level. A decisive break above $95,000 would likely attract additional buying interest, while failure to maintain support at $91,000 could lead to a deeper correction.Despite the short-term rally, our desk remains bearish on BTC over the next 6 to 12 months. Historical precedent suggests that President Trump’s tariff policies are unlikely to yield swift resolutions, particularly with China. The absence of disclosed trade agreements with any U.S. trading partners further reinforces this view. We believe the market may have overinterpreted the administration’s comments on tariff reductions, and without tangible progress, the recent bullish sentiment could reverse.Our desk is closely tracking several key developments that could shift our outlook:National Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: If other nations follow the U.S. in establishing Bitcoin reserves, this could signal a structural bullish catalyst for BTC.Trade Deal Agreements: Successful negotiations within the 90-day tariff pause could alleviate recession fears and support risk assets.Federal Reserve Monetary Policy: Any indication of monetary easing, such as interest rate cuts or quantitative easing, would likely provide a bullish tailwind for BTC and other risk assets.Despite BTC demonstrating short-term resilience in the face of a declining dollar and changing market attitudes, we maintain a cautious long-term perspective. The future trajectory is closely tied to geopolitical developments and the actions of central banks. Without significant progress on trade negotiations or accommodative monetary policy, we expect ongoing fluctuations and possible downward pressure on BTC in the months ahead.Macro at a glance Last Thursday (25-04-17)The European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced its deposit facility rate by 25 basis points to 2.25%, a move that was widely expected by the market. In its accompanying policy statement, the ECB emphasized the weakened growth outlook due to ongoing trade tensions.Initial jobless claims in the United States have continued to decline, with last week's figures showing 215,000 claims, which is below the anticipated 225,000.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Index for April was unexpectedly reported at -26.4, a significant deviation from the forecasted 2.2.On Tuesday (25-04-22)In April, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI) reported by the Bank of Japan experienced a growth of 2.2%, which fell short of the anticipated 2.4%.On Wednesday (25-04-23)The S&P Global Manufacturing PMI is expected to reach an unexpected 50.7 in April, significantly surpassing the anticipated 49.0 and March's figure of 50.2.Conversely, the S&P Global Services PMI is forecasted to be 51.4, which is below the predicted 52.8 and March's 54.4.New home sales in the US for March are reported at 724,000, exceeding the forecast of 684,000 and February's total of 674,000.Convert Portal Volume ChangeThe above table shows the volume change on our Convert Portal by zone. Recently, cryptocurrencies demonstrated remarkable resilience as stock markets experienced declines amid rising tariffs. The market sentiment improved following the speeches given by US Treasury Secretary Bessent and President Trump, who downplayed the tariff issues with China. This positive outlook sparked renewed investor interest in the crypto market, particularly in gaming and NFT-related tokens, as projects in these areas increasingly incorporate AI technology. In the Gaming sector, there was a significant surge in trading activity, resulting in a 309.2% increase in trading volume, largely fueled by growing interest in Voxies ($VOXEL) and Treasure ($MAGIC), as highlighted in our <Top Interest of the Week> section.

Binance,"Russia Plans to Launch Crypto Exchange for Qualified Investors
According to ShibDaily, Russia's Finance Ministry and Central Bank have announced plans to establish a cryptocurrency exchange aimed at qualified investors, operating under an experimental legal framework. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed during an expanded ministry board meeting that the initiative seeks to legalize crypto assets and bring crypto operations out of the shadows. Siluanov emphasized that this development will occur as part of operations permitted under the experimental legal regime, rather than domestically. In March, the Central Bank proposed to the government the allowance of cryptocurrency transactions under the country's experimental legal regime (ELR). The plan targets a new classification of participants—highly qualified investors—defined as individuals with over 100 million rubles in securities and deposits, or an annual income exceeding 50 million rubles in the previous year. Osman Kabaloev, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's Financial Policy Department, stated at the Blockchain Forum that the exact parameters defining these investors are still under discussion, with a lively debate anticipated in parliament. Russia's Central Bank has suggested allowing qualified investors to access settlement-based derivatives, securities, and digital financial assets linked to cryptocurrency values, provided the assets are not physically delivered to the investor. Despite these developments, the Central Bank continues to reject cryptocurrency as a legal form of payment and proposes a ban on crypto-based transactions between residents outside the experimental legal regime, advocating for penalties for those who breach this restriction. Deputy Finance Minister Ivan Chebeskov indicated that existing exchange platforms could be utilized for cryptocurrency trading within the experimental legal regime. He also mentioned that new entrants and trading platforms may be permitted, provided they meet specific licensing requirements. The initiative is not expected to launch for at least another six months. Currently, Russian citizens are allowed to buy and hold cryptocurrencies, but the use of digital currencies for transactions within the country remains prohibited. The absence of a centralized domestic cryptocurrency exchange means Russian investors must rely on foreign platforms to purchase digital assets. As Russian authorities continue to deliberate on the future of cryptocurrency regulation, the outcome of these discussions could significantly impact both local investors and the broader global crypto landscape.

Binance,"Ethereum Developers Propose Significant Gas Limit Increase for Fusaka Hard Fork
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum core developers are contemplating a substantial increase in the layer 1 gas limit as a key feature for the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, following the Pectra upgrade. The proposal, outlined in Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9678, suggests raising the gas limit to 150 million. This proposal was introduced on April 23 by Sophia Gold, a developer with the Ethereum Foundation's protocol support team. During the recent All Core Devs Execution (ACDE) meeting, discussions centered on making the gas limit increase a priority for Fusaka, as highlighted by Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko in an April 24 meeting summary. Beiko noted that an EIP has been drafted to align client defaults and maintain this as a priority. Although unconventional, this approach is not without precedent, as seen with EIP-7840. The plan is to merge the EIP early next week and formally include it in the next ACDE. The developers anticipate identifying necessary in-protocol changes to support a higher gas limit, which may lead to additional EIPs being incorporated into Fusaka, despite the fork's scope being finalized. The Pectra upgrade is set to launch on the mainnet in May, with Fusaka potentially going live in late 2025. The motivation behind increasing the gas limit stems from a strong interest in scaling layer 1 execution, which could be achieved by implementing new features. However, this requires guidance from execution layer developers, as higher gas limits may reveal bugs in clients that need addressing. This necessitates time for client developers to test and resolve any issues, making it sensible to include this as an EIP in a hard fork. While the gas limit is ultimately determined by validators, the developers agreed that having an EIP to coordinate client defaults would help prioritize this initiative and ensure all clients update their defaults by the time Fusaka is operational. The average Ethereum gas limit was approximately 30 million following an increase in August 2021, according to Ycharts data. Validators supported raising the network's gas limit on February 4, increasing the maximum gas used for transactions in a single Ethereum block to just under 36 million, as per Ycharts data.",04-25-2025

According to Cointelegraph, the Italian town of Fornelli, located in the Molise region, is set to honor the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, with a dedicated monument. The unveiling is scheduled for May 1, as announced in an April 23 Facebook post by the municipality. While specific details about the monument remain sparse, it is known that the artwork has been crafted by artist Mattia Pannoni and funded by the local government. Fornelli Mayor Giovanni Tedeschi emphasized the importance of embracing innovative ideas from the younger generation, highlighting the administration's commitment to forward-thinking initiatives. The town, with a population of approximately 1,800, claims to have the highest density of Bitcoin adoption globally. This move aligns with efforts seen in other regions, such as El Salvador's Bitcoin Beach and Switzerland's Zug, which have integrated cryptocurrency into their local economies to attract visitors and boost economic activity. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, whether an individual or a collective, remains one of the most intriguing mysteries in the cryptocurrency world since the release of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008. Artists across the globe, including those within the crypto community, have attempted to capture the essence of Nakamoto through various artistic expressions.

The monument in Fornelli will be located in the Piazza Umberto I area, marking a significant cultural and technological milestone for the town.

Binance,"Federal Reserve Withdraws Guidance on Crypto Activities for Banks
According to Cointelegraph, the U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a significant change in its approach to overseeing banks involved in cryptocurrency and stablecoin activities. In a statement released on April 24, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve revealed that it is rescinding its 2022 supervisory letter. This letter had previously set an expectation for state member banks to provide advance notification of any planned or ongoing crypto-asset activities.

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is also retracting its 2023 supervisory letter, which had implications for how state banks could participate in stablecoin activities.

Binance,"Ethereum's Layer-2 Scaling Strategy Sparks Debate Amid Fee Reductions
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's approach to scaling through multiple layer-2 networks, each with distinct transaction processing speeds and parameters, offers the network a potentially limitless array of high-throughput chains. Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail, a unified chain abstraction solution, highlighted this aspect in a recent interview. Arjun noted that Ethereum's strategy differs fundamentally from high-throughput competitors with monolithic architectures. The rollup-centric roadmap allows various teams to experiment with diverse execution environments and block times, fostering a range of high-throughput sidechains rather than a singular architecture on any monolithic layer-1. However, Arjun cautioned that without true interoperability, transitioning between L2s remains as complex as bridging assets across different blockchain ecosystems. Arjun's viewpoint contrasts with critics of Ethereum's L2-focused approach, who argue that these scaling solutions isolate liquidity and ultimately undermine the base layer. Critics claim that L2s contribute significantly to Ether's (ETH) poor price performance over the past year. Meanwhile, Ethereum's layer-1 network fees reached five-year lows in April 2025, with average transaction fees around $0.16. Brian Quinlivan, marketing director at Santiment, an onchain analytics firm, suggested that the fee reduction indicates decreased demand for the base layer and diminishing investor interest in Ethereum. Quinlivan noted in an April 16 blog post that the drop in fees coincides with fewer ETH transactions and interactions with smart contracts, including those in decentralized finance, digital collectibles like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital asset sectors. The decline in Ethereum's base layer transaction fees and waning retail interest has led many institutional investors to reduce their Ether allocations and revise their price outlooks for the digital asset, which ranks as the second-largest by market capitalization. This situation has sparked discussions about the future of Ethereum's scaling strategy and its impact on the network's overall performance and investor sentiment.",04-24-2025

According to PANews, Ethena founder Guy Young clarified on the X platform that Ethena and Tether are not competitors but rather mutually beneficial entities. In a market where approximately 70% of perpetual contracts are denominated in USDT, each short position added by Ethena creates new demand for USDT. This is because the counterparty must use USDT as collateral to establish long positions. This mechanism implies that for every dollar of USDe issued, supported by perpetual contracts, there is an approximate $0.7 increase in demand for USDT. Young emphasized that Tether does not need to launch its own yield products, as traders are already using USDT as collateral, paying annualized interest rates of 10% to 30% to go long on perpetual contracts. Ethena serves as a channel to convert this demand. The behavior of crypto market users is extreme, either seeking maximum liquidity or the highest returns. As interest rates decline, the middle ground, characterized by low liquidity but marketed as risk-free returns, will be eliminated. The trading sector needs to offer more liquidity and distribution advantages than Tether, while the savings sector must provide higher returns than Ethena, making the middle path difficult to succeed. Young believes that the 'barbell strategy' formed by Tether and Ethena represents the ultimate form of industry development.",04-24-2025

According to Cointelegraph, fintech leader Revolut has achieved a record-breaking year in 2024, doubling its pre-tax profits to 1 billion British pounds ($1.3 billion). This remarkable growth is attributed to a surge in customer numbers and a revival in cryptocurrency trading. The company's annual report, released on April 24, highlights a significant increase in profits from 438 million pounds in 2023, alongside a revenue jump to 3.1 billion pounds from 1.8 billion pounds. A major factor in Revolut's success was its wealth division, encompassing stock and digital asset trading, which generated 506 million pounds in revenue—nearly quadrupling its 2023 figures—as crypto trading activity saw a resurgence. Revolut's customer base expanded by nearly 15 million in 2024, surpassing 50 million users. This growth fueled revenue from card payment fees and interest on deposits, the fintech's primary income sources. ""2024 was another landmark year for Revolut, with continued growth across all key business areas,"" stated founder and CEO Nik Storonsky in the report. A significant milestone for the company was obtaining a UK banking license in July 2024 after a three-year regulatory process. This license enables Revolut to broaden its lending services, including credit cards and buy-now-pay-later products, with mortgages currently in testing. Storonsky remarked, ""We received a UK banking license (with restrictions), paving the way for future product enhancements in our home market."" In May 2024, Revolut launched Revolut X, a desktop crypto exchange aimed at experienced traders, offering trading for 100 tokens with low fees and real-time on/off-ramp capabilities. Plans are underway to expand this platform to mobile in 2025. By November, Revolut extended its crypto exchange across Europe, introducing Revolut X in 30 new markets within the European Economic Area, including Belgium, Cyprus, and Denmark. Throughout the year, Revolut also expanded its digital asset services, providing customers with access to cryptocurrencies alongside other investment options like stocks, ETFs, bonds, and commodities within its app ecosystem. Despite its impressive growth, Revolut faces challenges in converting app users into primary banking customers. Increasing deposit volumes is crucial for funding future lending operations and competing with established retail banks.

Binance,"Musk's Government Role Sparks Debate Amid Contradictory Statements
According to BlockBeats, Elon Musk made conflicting statements regarding his government role during Tesla's earnings call. Initially, Musk suggested he would reduce his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May. However, he later indicated he might remain involved in government affairs until 2029, when U.S. President Donald Trump's term ends. Musk stated his intention to continue working on government matters to prevent waste and fraud, dedicating one or two days a week as long as it remains beneficial and desired by the President. Musk's current role in the government is at the edge of legal boundaries in Washington. The White House describes him as a ""special government employee."" However, Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, argues that granting Musk extensive powers to manage DOGE, dismiss employees, and cut federal agencies was a misapplication of the Special Government Employee Act from the start. The Trump administration has been criticized for exploiting this mechanism by hiring Musk and others to bypass restrictions typically imposed on full-time employees, such as conflict of interest and security clearance requirements.",04-24-2025

According to Cointelegraph, decentralized exchange KiloEx has announced plans to compensate traders and stakers affected by a $7.5 million exploit that temporarily halted its operations in April. In a statement on April 24, KiloEx assured traders with open positions during the suspension that they would receive full compensation for any increased losses or decreased profits. The platform committed to covering the difference, urging traders to close their positions promptly once operations resume to ensure accurate compensation calculations. KiloEx also addressed its Hybrid Vault stakers, confirming that the stolen funds had been fully reinjected into the vault, leaving staker earnings and principal unaffected. Additionally, the platform promised an extra 10% annual percentage yield (APY) as a bonus for eligible stakers who had funds in the vault before the platform's resumption. This move aims to reassure users of the platform's commitment to maintaining their investments. Earlier, on April 15, KiloEx offered a 10% bounty to the hacker responsible for the exploit, allowing them to retain $750,000 if they returned 90% of the stolen funds. The platform warned of revealing the hacker's identity and pursuing legal action if they failed to comply. Following this, security platforms detected transactions suggesting the hacker returned the stolen funds. By April 18, KiloEx announced it would drop all legal actions and reward the hacker with the promised 10% white hat bounty. The exploit, which occurred on April 14, involved a price oracle vulnerability that allowed the attacker to manipulate prices for illicit gains. Security firm PeckShield identified the vulnerability, noting that the attacker exploited a permissionless function to craft unauthorized requests. This enabled the attacker to open a position at an artificially low price and close it at a higher price, resulting in illegitimate profits.

This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the platform charging this fee, to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts and keep contract prices aligned with asset prices. A funding rate of 0.01% is considered the benchmark rate. When the funding rate exceeds 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market sentiment.

Binance,"U.S. Prosecutors Seek Lengthy Sentence for Mango Markets Exploit Convict
According to Cointelegraph, U.S. federal prosecutors have requested a district judge to impose a sentence of at least six and a half years on Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who was convicted for exploiting the decentralized exchange Mango Markets in 2022, resulting in a $110 million loss. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 1, and prosecutors are urging U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian to consider a prison term ranging from 78 to 97 months, as detailed in an April 22 filing in a New York district court. Prosecutors assert that such a sentence is warranted due to Eisenberg's conviction in April 2024 for wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation related to the Mango Markets exploit. Additionally, Eisenberg faces separate charges for possessing child pornography. The prosecution emphasizes that the sentence should reflect the severity of the crimes, uphold respect for the law, deter future criminal activities, and safeguard the public. They argue that fraud resulting in over $100 million in losses and the shutdown of a business constitutes a grave violation of criminal law, necessitating a sentence proportionate to the crime. Mango Markets, which launched in August 2021, announced its decision to wind down operations on January 11, with a subsequent post on January 18 indicating a shutdown date of February 3. During Eisenberg's trial in April 2024, his legal team contended that he executed a legitimate trading strategy, profiting $110 million from Mango Markets. Eisenberg has returned approximately $67 million of the funds post-exploit, retaining over $40 million following a community governance vote. In an April 22 impact statement, Mango Markets' legal representatives requested the court to grant $47 million in restitution, aiming to restore the exchange and its DAO. They stressed that while Eisenberg's actions cannot be undone, returning the misappropriated funds is crucial to addressing the wrongdoing. Mango Markets acknowledged that no monetary compensation can fully repair the reputational damage and suffering caused by Eisenberg's actions, but restitution would aid in mitigating the impact. Eisenberg was arrested in December 2022, and his sentencing has faced multiple postponements. Initially set for December 12, 2024, it was delayed to February 11, 2025, and subsequently to April 10, 2025. Eisenberg's legal team attributed the delays to the complexity of the sentencing issues.",04-24-2025

According to Cointelegraph, Scott Melker, host of The Wolf Of All Streets podcast, has reported that scammers have impersonated him, leading to a significant financial loss for at least one victim. On April 23, Melker revealed that a private investigator informed him about a client who was defrauded of $4 million by a Nigerian group using his identity. The scammers reportedly used a fake driver's license featuring Melker's image and a counterfeit email account to deceive their targets. The fraudulent scheme involved sophisticated AI technology to create convincing fake IDs and conduct Zoom calls, further enhancing the deception. Melker noted that the scammers even impersonated his family members to bolster their credibility.

Crypto adviser and trader ""Nebraskan Gooner"" emphasized that while the fake ID used in the scam could be easily identified through a simple Google search, the increasing sophistication of such operations is concerning.

Binance,"Trump Says He Has No Plans to Fire Fed Chair Powell, Markets Rally
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he does not intend to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, following several days of heightened criticism aimed at the central bank’s decision to hold interest rates steady.“I have no intention of firing him,” Trump said during a press briefing in the Oval Office. “I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.”The president’s statement marked a clear de-escalation from earlier rhetoric during the Easter holiday weekend, when Trump repeatedly criticized Powell for being “too slow” in adjusting monetary policy in the face of global economic uncertainty.Immediate Market ReactionU.S. equity index futures jumped nearly 2% during Tuesday evening trading as markets welcomed the renewed political stability around the Federal Reserve’s leadership. The rebound came after Monday’s broad sell-off that had impacted stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar on the back of Trump’s prior comments.The president’s softened stance helped to alleviate investor fears of central bank politicization or unexpected leadership changes during a period of high macroeconomic sensitivity.Market Sensitivity to Fed IndependenceTrump’s comments had sparked concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence, a cornerstone of U.S. monetary policy. Although the U.S. president does not have unilateral authority to remove the Fed Chair without cause, markets had become jittery over the tone of recent White House remarks.While Trump has continued to pressure the Fed to lower borrowing costs more aggressively, Tuesday’s remarks signal a temporary truce that could allow policymakers to refocus on economic data rather than political expectations, according to Reuters.",04-23-2025

Binance,"QCP: Bitcoin Breaks $90K as Institutions Embrace “Digital Gold” and Risk Appetite Returns
New Bitcoin Acquisition Fund Launches Backed by Cantor, SoftBank, Tether, and BitfinexAccording to its latest market commentary, QCP Capital reported that Bitcoin has successfully broken through the key psychological barrier of $90,000, marking a renewed surge in investor appetite for risk-on assets — even as traditional safe havens like gold slipped 6%.The update comes as a consortium of major financial and crypto players — including Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex — reportedly launched a bold new Bitcoin acquisition fund dubbed 21 Capital (tentative name). The fund aims to become a flagship institutional vehicle for long-term BTC accumulation.Market Boosted by Trump’s Pro-Crypto Stance and Fund FormationQCP noted that the formation of 21 Capital aligns with a decisive shift in U.S. policy, as the Trump administration increasingly supports the “digital gold” narrative. This policy tailwind has delivered a major boost to crypto sentiment, pushing Bitcoin to fresh multi-month highs.“Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $90,000 highlights renewed capital flows into digital assets,” QCP wrote. “Gold’s retreat underscores the reallocation of risk appetite back toward cryptocurrencies.”The fund launch also arrives as institutional sentiment evolves from “testing the waters” to full engagement, with QCP noting that 21 Capital is positioned to become a new benchmark for long-term conviction in Bitcoin — potentially replacing Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as the face of institutional belief in crypto.Macro Risks Remain, But Fed Stability Helps Market ReboundQCP also highlighted a critical source of recent macro stability: President Trump’s decision not to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The announcement helped ease pressure on long-term U.S. Treasury yields and reduced a significant “tail risk” for markets.While bond markets have stabilized, U.S. equities continue to hover near record highs, reflecting a cautiously optimistic stance from investors. However, QCP warned that the environment remains far from resolved:“Trade frictions, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory uncertainty continue to hang over markets,” the firm said. “Investors remain hyper-sensitive to potential macro turning points.”Institutional Crypto Market OutlookWith BTC climbing back above $94,000 and institutional products like 21 Capital entering the scene, analysts believe the current cycle is entering a new phase of credibility and capital allocation.If confirmed, this could mark a structural pivot toward long-term accumulation and reinforce Bitcoin’s status as a macro asset class — supported not only by ETFs but also by bespoke institutional funds and sovereign-level positioning.",04-23-2025
Binance,"Glassnode: Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $97K as Selling Pressure Builds
$100K Breakout May Be Delayed as 392K BTC Sit at Break-Even ZoneAs Bitcoin eyes a potential breakout toward $100,000, new data from on-chain analytics platform Glassnode highlights a critical resistance zone at $97,000, where substantial selling pressure could emerge.In its latest report, Glassnode revealed that approximately 392,000 BTC are held by investors whose cost basis is clustered around the $97,000 level. These holders may be inclined to sell at break-even, creating a potential supply barrier that could slow or temporarily cap Bitcoin’s current rally.Cost Basis Cluster Creates Headwind Near $97K“If Bitcoin is to break through the $100,000 mark again, it still needs to overcome considerable supply-side resistance,” Glassnode stated.The cost basis distribution map shows that the $97K level is densely packed with prior buyers who may view the current price zone as an opportunity to exit or de-risk, especially after enduring recent market volatility.This makes $97,000 a key psychological and technical resistance level, not just a round-number checkpoint on the way to six figures.Market Outlook: Bulls Eye $100K, But Supply Wall LoomsBitcoin is currently trading around $94,000–$95,000, following a sharp rebound fueled by ETF inflows, macroeconomic optimism, and institutional buying pressure across major exchanges.While sentiment has flipped bullish in recent sessions, Glassnode cautions that a clean break above $100,000 will require the market to absorb substantial selling volume in the $96K–$98K zone.“This is a region where prior buyers may look to exit positions after recovering from underwater levels,” the report noted.Historical ContextResistance at tightly clustered cost basis levels is a recurring theme in Bitcoin bull markets. Similar zones emerged around $20K in late 2020 and $64K in late 2021, each time resulting in temporary slowdowns or corrections before further continuation.The current challenge at $97K underscores the psychological weight of round numbers, and the importance of spot demand and institutional conviction in overcoming supply walls.",04-23-2025

Binance,"CryptoQuant CEO: If Bitcoin Hits ATH Before Q4, Cycle Theory May Be “Completely Abandoned”
Ki Young Ju Says Event-Driven Price Moves Are Challenging On-Chain ModelsCryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says Bitcoin’s recent price action is putting traditional cycle theory to the test, adding that if BTC reaches a new all-time high before Q4 2025, he will ""completely abandon"" the idea that Bitcoin follows predictable four-year market cycles.The comments were made in a social media post on April 23, as Bitcoin traded above $94,000, up more than 10% from when Ki previously called for the end of the bull cycle.“Bitcoin fell 10% after I declared the end of the bull cycle, but now it’s 10% higher than when I made that call,” he noted.Cycle Theory Under PressureKi Young Ju is known for his on-chain, long-term supply-demand models, which typically rely on historical patterns and network activity to forecast market tops and bottoms. However, he now suggests that macroeconomic unpredictability and political events — particularly U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff-driven headlines — are distorting traditional signals.“In a market that reacts to every word of Trump, short-term price movements are more event-driven, which makes traditional cyclical on-chain indicators difficult to use,” he explained.He emphasized that while on-chain data remains a powerful tool, current conditions highlight how even experienced analysts can reach very different interpretations.A New Market Structure?The most striking remark from Ki centered around what happens if Bitcoin breaks above its previous all-time high (~$109,000) before Q4 2025.“If Bitcoin hits a record high before the fourth quarter, I will completely abandon the cycle theory,” he said.“A market without a clear cycle may be completely different from what we have previously known.”He concluded by stating that in such a case, the “die-hard bulls will be right” — and Bitcoin could continue rising without the constraints of historical cycles.Market Outlook: Event-Driven vs. On-ChainKi’s remarks reflect a growing divide between technical, on-chain analysis and the current event-driven, macro-reactive market environment. With Bitcoin climbing in response to geopolitical easing, ETF inflows, and U.S. dollar weakness, some analysts suggest that BTC may be entering a new structural phase, where institutional demand and macro trends outweigh traditional cyclical models.",04-23-2025

Binance,"Challenges in Adapting A2A and MCP Protocols for Web3 AI Agents
According to PANews, the potential adoption of Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP protocols as communication standards for web3 AI Agents presents significant challenges due to the distinct differences between web2 and web3 ecosystems. The first challenge lies in the maturity of applications. While A2A and MCP have quickly gained traction in the web2 domain by enhancing already mature application scenarios, web3 AI Agents are still in the early stages of development, lacking deep application contexts such as DeFAI and GameFAI. This makes it difficult for these protocols to be directly applied and utilized effectively in the web3 environment. For instance, in web2, users can seamlessly update code on platforms like GitHub using the MCP protocol without leaving their current work environment. However, in a web3 setting, executing on-chain transactions with locally trained strategies can become confusing when analyzing on-chain data. Another significant hurdle is the absence of foundational infrastructure in the web3 space. To build a comprehensive ecosystem, web3 AI Agents must address the lack of essential components such as a unified data layer, Oracle layer, intent execution layer, and decentralized consensus layer. In web2, A2A protocols allow agents to easily collaborate using standardized APIs. In contrast, web3 environments pose substantial challenges even for simple cross-DEX arbitrage operations. Consider a scenario where a user instructs an AI Agent to buy ETH from Uniswap when the price drops below $1600 and sell when it rises. This seemingly straightforward task requires the agent to tackle web3-specific issues like real-time on-chain data analysis, dynamic gas fee optimization, slippage control, and MEV protection. In web2, such tasks are simplified by standardized API calls, highlighting the stark difference in infrastructure maturity between the two environments. Furthermore, web3 AI Agents must address unique demands that differ from web2 protocols and functionalities. For example, in web2, users can easily book the cheapest flight using A2A protocols. However, in web3, when a user wants to transfer USDC cross-chain to Solana for liquidity mining, the agent must understand user intent, balance security, atomicity, and cost efficiency, and execute complex on-chain operations. If these operations increase security risks, the perceived convenience becomes meaningless, rendering the demand a false need. In conclusion, while the value of A2A and MCP protocols is undeniable, expecting them to seamlessly adapt to the web3 AI Agent landscape without modifications is unrealistic. The gaps in infrastructure deployment present opportunities for builders to innovate and fill these voids.",04-23-2025

Binance,"Ethereum News: Ethereum Surges 15% as Market Dominance Rebounds From All-Time Low
ETH Reclaims $1,800, Outperforms Bitcoin and the Broader MarketEthereum (ETH) is staging a strong comeback after weeks of underperformance, jumping nearly 15% in the past 24 hours to reclaim the $1,800 level. The rally comes as ETH’s market dominance rebounds from an all-time low of 7%, signaling renewed interest in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.According to TradingView, Ethereum dominance fell to its lowest point since September 2019 on April 22, before bouncing back to 7.5% as of April 23.“You can hate Ethereum all you want, but when it has a big day, the entire crypto ecosystem goes up,” noted popular trader Income Sharks on X.Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin and Total MarketEthereum’s 24-hour performance has outpaced that of Bitcoin (+6%) and the broader crypto market (+5%, with total capitalization returning to the $3 trillion mark). Since crashing to $1,400 on April 9, ETH has now recovered almost 30%, reversing losses caused by earlier fears over trade tensions and market-wide risk aversion.Some analysts now believe Ethereum may have put in a local bottom, with oversold conditions creating the setup for a sharp reversal.Technical and Fundamental Catalysts AlignAccording to 10x Research’s Markus Thielen, Ethereum’s rebound is being driven by a combination of technical and structural factors.“It hasn’t taken much to drive Ethereum higher, as a heavily shorted market is now experiencing a squeeze,” Thielen told Cointelegraph.He added that ETH was oversold on both daily and weekly charts, and with an upcoming upgrade moving to mainnet, a fundamental catalyst is also supporting the move.Mixed Views on Independent ETH StrengthWhile some traders see ETH breaking out on its own momentum, others remain cautious. Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, noted that Ethereum’s rally may still be closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements and the broader macro environment.“Ether’s gain was largely due to it tracking the price of Bitcoin and the overall market,” Mei said, adding that Paul Atkins’ confirmation as SEC Chair also lifted sentiment across digital assets.ETH Dominance Holds Critical SupportAnalyst Rekt Capital highlighted ETH’s dominance bounce as a key technical milestone:“ETH managed to protect 2019 all-time lows as support,” he posted on April 22, referring to the critical 7% dominance level.Should the rally continue, ETH dominance may move back toward the 8–10% range, a level more consistent with its historical role in market cycles and DeFi leadership, according to Cointelegraph.",04-23-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin News Today: Bitcoin Whales Push BTC Past $90K as ‘Spoofy the Whale’ Backs Off Binance Order Book
Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the spotlight after large-scale buyers returned to the market, with whales on both Binance and Coinbase aggressively accumulating BTC as prices broke above $90,000 for the first time in over six weeks.Data from CryptoQuant shows that whales are once again ""pushing the market up,"" ending weeks of sideways movement and reviving bullish sentiment across key exchanges.At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $93,539, as whale-led buying power visibly lifts order book resistance and reclaims major psychological price levels.Coinbase Premium Turns Positive Amid Risk-On RallyThe Coinbase BTC premium, a key market indicator measuring the price gap between BTC/USD on Coinbase and BTC/USDT on Binance, has turned decisively positive — its highest level since February.A positive premium typically signals strong U.S. institutional buying and has historically coincided with bullish momentum. This week’s uptick suggests that Coinbase whales are back in accumulation mode, even as retail investor activity remains subdued.“These two exchanges, which can be considered the largest in the world, have their whales alternately pushing the market up, creating a very positive situation,” noted CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan.He added that retail participation remains low following weeks of volatile shakeouts, leaving room for large investors to take the lead.‘Spoofy the Whale’ Abandons Resistance Wall at $90KAdding to the bullish picture is a dramatic shift in Binance order book activity. A long-standing wall of resistance at $90,000 — attributed by analysts to a single high-volume entity known as “Spoofy the Whale” — has now disappeared.“Spoofy the Whale has relinquished control of the BTC order book on Binance,” said Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, in an X post on April 23.Alan highlighted that whale buying has increased across all classes of investors, with spot order book heatmaps showing a clear transition from defensive selling to active accumulation.However, he cautioned that Bitcoin must decisively reclaim its 2025 yearly open near $93,500 to confirm a sustained breakout and end the current multimonth downtrend, according to Cointelegraph.Market Outlook: Whales Lead, Retail FollowsAnalysts suggest the current rally is being driven primarily by institutional accumulation, with retail investors still cautious after recent volatility. But with order books flipping bullish, ETF inflows rising, and macro tailwinds building, the market may be entering a new phase of upside momentum.“The market has effectively shaken off the small fish,” Crypto Dan noted, “and that means it’s now ready for a rise.”",04-23-2025

Largest Daily Inflow Since January Signals Growing Institutional ConfidenceBitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their strongest daily net inflows in over three months, as institutional investors returned to the market amid signs of easing U.S.-China trade tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar.According to data from Farside Investors, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $912 million in cumulative net inflows on April 22, marking the highest single-day inflow since January 21, 2025.“Bitcoin ETPs just saw the largest daily inflows since 21st January in a dramatic improvement in sentiment,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.Trade War De-escalation Triggers Risk-On SentimentInvestor confidence improved after President Donald Trump signaled a substantial reduction in tariffs on Chinese imports, describing the current 145% rate as unsustainable. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also hinted at a more diplomatic stance, calling the standoff “unsustainable” in remarks to Bloomberg on April 22.The policy shift toward de-escalation has been interpreted as a tailwind for risk assets — including Bitcoin — prompting institutional capital to return via regulated ETF products.Bitcoin Breaks Above $93K Amid ETF SurgeFueled by growing ETF inflows and a favorable macro backdrop, Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $93,000 on April 23, reaching its highest level in seven weeks. According to Cointelegraph, the surge may mark a pivotal shift in the four-year cycle, potentially accelerating BTC’s trajectory toward new highs before the end of 2025.“This might be the last chance to buy Bitcoin below $100,000,” predicted Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, citing incoming U.S. Treasury buybacks as the next major catalyst.Weakening Dollar Reinforces Bitcoin's Safe-Haven NarrativeAdding to the bullish backdrop is the ongoing decline in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which has dropped nearly 9% year-to-date, hitting a three-year low of 98.8, per TradingView data.“Macro factors like a weakening dollar and rising gold correlation are reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against economic volatility,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research.Gold, which hit an all-time high this week, is increasingly moving in tandem with Bitcoin — strengthening the safe-haven narrative amid global macro uncertainty.Analysts: Bitcoin No Longer “Shadowing Tech,” Now a Macro AssetMarket analysts note that Bitcoin is decoupling from tech stocks and gaining traction as a macro-economic hedge, similar to gold.“Bitcoin is no longer trading in the shadows of tech. It’s becoming a lens through which macro uncertainty is priced,” said Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at Nexo.“Its strength amid dollar weakness, record gold prices, and renewed institutional buying reflects a market recalibrating what safety looks like.”Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik echoed this sentiment, noting that Bitcoin has recently behaved “less like Nasdaq, more like gold,” especially as economic recession fears loom.",04-23-2025

Binance,"Crypto News: Why Is the Crypto Market Up Today? Short Squeeze, Trade War Optimism, and Technical Breakout Drive Rally
Total Market Cap Rises 6.7% as Bitcoin Hits $94K and Ethereum Surges 13%The crypto market is surging today, fueled by a combination of macroeconomic relief, massive short liquidations, and a bullish technical breakout in total market capitalization.As of April 23, the total crypto market cap has risen 6.7% to $2.94 trillion, led by a strong rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are up 6.4% and 13% respectively. Market analysts point to three key drivers behind the rally:﻿1. Easing U.S.-China Trade War Tensions Boost Risk AppetiteA major catalyst behind today’s crypto market rally is renewed optimism over a de-escalation in the U.S.-China tariff standoff.On April 22, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg that the current tariff structure with China is “unsustainable,” signaling openness to a lowering of tariffs in the near future. Later that day, President Donald Trump echoed this view, stating that tariffs “will come down substantially” from the current 145% level.Trump also clarified that he does not plan to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, easing market fears about central bank instability.These developments have contributed to a broader risk-on sentiment, with investors piling into digital assets amid renewed confidence in global trade and macroeconomic stability.﻿2. Short Squeeze Unwinds Over $540M in Bearish BetsThe rally has also been amplified by a massive short squeeze, according to data from CoinGlass.In the past 24 hours, $624 million in crypto positions have been liquidated — $545 million of which were shorts, marking the largest single-day short liquidation event of 2025.“Short squeeze!” CoinGlass noted, highlighting the scale of forced buying pressure that accelerated Bitcoin’s climb beyond $93,000.This liquidation event mirrors similar spikes in previous bull cycles, including the Nov. 6 surge, where $426 million in short positions were wiped out, leading to a $356 billion increase in market cap.﻿3. Technical Breakout Confirms Bullish Trend ReversalFrom a charting perspective, the crypto market has broken out of a multimonth falling wedge, a bullish pattern suggesting trend reversal.The TOTAL chart — representing the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies — broke above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and successfully retested the wedge resistance at $2.6 trillion, with price now targeting the next resistance range between $2.93T and $2.94T, marked by the 100-day and 200-day SMAs.﻿The relative strength index (RSI) has also surged from 30 on April 7 to 65, reflecting growing bullish momentum and sustained buying interest.Technical Target: If the breakout holds, TOTAL could reach $3.12 trillion, a 7.5% upside from current levels.Will Bitcoin Hit $95K?With Bitcoin trading near $94,000 and traders eyeing $95K as the next psychological barrier, momentum remains strong. Combined with improving macro conditions and favorable technical indicators, the market appears poised for continued gains — though resistance at major moving averages may test bullish resolve, according to Cointelegraph.",04-23-2025

Binance,"Vaulta (Formerly EOS) Interview: How the OG Layer 1 Is Reinventing Itself for the Web3 Banking Era
Once known as EOS, the project has undergone a major transformation, emerging as Vaulta, a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for Web3 banking, Bitcoin-native DeFi, and real-world finance. In this exclusive Binance News interview, Vaulta’s leadership team walks us through the rebrand, its powerful infrastructure, and why it’s now positioning itself as the Banking Operating System of Web3.From native BTC yield and 1-second finality to stablecoin payment rails and tokenized assets, Vaulta is making bold moves to reclaim its spot among top Layer 1 networks. Below, we break down the full conversation into six parts for clarity. Reintroducing Vaulta — The New Face of EOS1. How would you introduce the EOS network today to someone who hasn’t followed the project in years?What began as EOS—a scalable, fee-less blockchain—has now matured into Vaulta, a next-gen financial Layer 1. Vaulta is engineered for Web3 Banking, offering 1-second finality, Bitcoin-native yield through exSat, and robust, modular infrastructure designed for banks, fintechs, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.2. What makes Vaulta stand out among other Layer 1 blockchains?Vaulta combines reliability, speed, and financial composability. With 2,600+ days of uninterrupted uptime, it’s among the most battle-tested chains. Its standout feature is exSat, a Bitcoin-integrated virtual chain managing UTXO data for native BTC staking, delta-neutral yield, and real-time settlement. Vaulta's Savanna Consensus Algorithm brings 1-second finality—crucial for financial-grade applications. Native role-based permissions further enable secure enterprise use cases.3. Can you summarize EOS’s journey from its launch to this new chapter as Vaulta?Launched in 2018, EOS aimed to revolutionize scalability. But as priorities diverged, its development slowed—until the EOS Network Foundation (ENF) was born in 2021 to realign efforts. Key milestones followed: EOS EVM, Antelope IBC, Tokenomics revamp, exSat Network, and the Spring 1.0 upgrade with 1-second finality. All of this set the stage for Vaulta. Why EOS Rebranded as Vaulta4. Why did you decide to rebrand EOS, and what message does “Vaulta” send to the ecosystem?Vaulta reflects a core transformation—from general-purpose smart contract platform to financial infrastructure purpose-built for Web3 Banking. With the return of global political leaders like Trump and growing demand for digital asset frameworks, Vaulta arrives at the perfect time to signal its readiness to serve banks, fintechs, and retail.5. What’s fundamentally changed in the project's mission and focus? EOS lacked product-market fit. Vaulta delivers it. Today, Vaulta supports: Bitcoin-native DeFi, tokenized real-world assets, compliance-ready custody, and stablecoin-powered global payments (e.g., VirgoPay, launching May 2025).6. How does Vaulta differentiate itself in today’s crowded Layer 1 market?Vaulta is not just a blockchain—it’s a modular financial OS offering: Native Bitcoin integration, RAM-based on-chain data storage, Savanna-powered finality, and a strategic focus on Wealth, Insurance, Payments, and Investment. Deep Dive Into Vaulta’s Technology7. What were the major innovations in the recent Spring 1.0 upgrade?The upgrade introduced Savanna Consensus, parallel execution environments, and high customizability for fintechs and banks. It allows custom virtual chains to operate securely and independently—ideal for institutions.8. How does Vaulta EVM compare with other Ethereum-compatible chains?Vaulta EVM is fully Solidity-compatible, but runs on faster, deterministic finality. It supports both Ethereum dev tools and Vaulta-native features like RAM storage and permissions. exSat, built on Vaulta EVM, now boasts $600M+ TVL, 40 validators, and Bitcoin-native DeFi.9. What are you doing to attract new dApps and institutional partners?Vaulta is onboarding custodians, tokenization platforms, and CeDeFi specialists. VirgoPay is a prime example. Developer tools include MetaMask Snaps, Unicove portal, and middleware for seamless integration. Vaulta Tokenomics and Ecosystem Incentives10. Will EOS tokens retain any value or be converted in Vaulta’s ecosystem? Yes. A 1:1 EOS-to-Vaulta swap kicks off Vaulta’s token economy. Core updates: Fixed 2.1B supply, 4-year halving, Vaulta token used for staking, fees, and RAM access.11.

Trump’s Executive Order Sets Stage for Bitcoin Allocation, Market Eyes Incoming Policy DisclosureAccording to a report by PANews, the United States may soon unveil details regarding the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a policy initiative introduced through an executive order signed by former President Donald Trump in early March.The executive order directed the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to assess both legal and investment implications of establishing such a reserve. The Treasury has a 60-day evaluation window, which is now entering its final two weeks — suggesting that an official policy announcement could arrive before early May.Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a Catalyst for Crypto ReboundAnalysts suggest that market speculation surrounding the potential size and structure of the Bitcoin reserve may be a key driver behind the recent rebound in crypto asset prices, including Bitcoin’s climb back above the $92,000 mark.While no specific allocation strategy has yet been confirmed, expectations of state-level accumulation of digital assets — particularly Bitcoin — are contributing to a renewed bullish narrative, especially as traditional markets remain under pressure.Political Pressure on the Fed Adds Fuel to Bitcoin MomentumIn addition to the reserve news, growing political discourse questioning the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve has had a positive spillover effect on Bitcoin.

Binance,"SEC and Federal Prosecutors Charge Man in $200 Million Crypto Scheme
According to Cointelegraph, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors have charged Ramil Palafox, a dual citizen of the United States and the Philippines, with orchestrating a crypto scheme that defrauded 90,000 individuals out of $200 million. The SEC announced on April 22 that Palafox allegedly misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds through his company, PGI Global, between January 2020 and October 2021. The regulator accused Palafox of employing a multilevel marketing model to execute a ""Ponzi-like"" scam until the company's collapse in 2021. He reportedly attracted investors with false claims of expertise in the crypto industry and a purported AI-powered auto-trading platform. The SEC further alleged that Palafox hosted extravagant events in Dubai and Las Vegas to recruit new members, offering referral bonuses to entice others to join. Investor funds were used to pay existing investors and promote the scheme, as well as for Palafox's personal gain. Scott Thompson, associate director of the SEC's Philadelphia office, stated that Palafox lured investors with promises of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading. Instead of trading, Palafox allegedly purchased cars, watches, and homes for himself and his family using millions of dollars from investor funds. The SEC is charging Palafox with violating anti-fraud and registration provisions of federal securities laws, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent him from future sales of securities and crypto assets, repayment of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC's complaint coincides with action from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which has arraigned Palafox on criminal charges. An indictment filed under seal on March 13 accuses Palafox of wire fraud, money laundering, and unlawful monetary transactions. Prosecutors claim Palafox misled investors with false promises of daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 3% from Bitcoin trading, concealing information about PGI's profitability, licenses, and business activities. The indictment alleges that Palafox assured investors that substantial returns were generated through the company's crypto exchanges, claiming his traders could profit regardless of Bitcoin's price fluctuations. However, the Justice Department asserts that most investors' money was never used to buy or trade Bitcoin, resulting in significant losses for many.

Binance,"Potential U.S. Interest Rate Cuts Analyzed Amid Trade Negotiations
According to BlockBeats, a research report by China International Capital Corporation (CICC) outlines two potential scenarios regarding U.S. trade negotiations and their impact on interest rates. In the first scenario, if negotiations with trade partners show little progress and high effective tariff rates persist after 90 days, the income effect could dominate, leading to weakened economic demand. This situation might prompt the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates from July, with a total reduction of up to 100 basis points over the year. In the second scenario, successful negotiations could lead to reduced tariffs, with the substitution effect resulting in a milder demand shock. However, inflationary pressures might become more persistent, potentially causing the Federal Reserve to delay easing measures, with only a minor rate cut expected in December. For the market, although monetary easing would occur earlier in the first scenario, such ""recessionary"" rate cuts would reflect a deterioration in economic fundamentals, potentially suppressing risk assets.",04-23-2025

Binance,"Hashflare Co-Founders Face Legal Confusion Amid Deportation Orders
According to Cointelegraph, the legal proceedings involving Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin, co-founders of the crypto mining service Hashflare, have taken a complex turn following directives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The two Estonian nationals, who are currently facing charges in the United States, received letters from DHS instructing them to ""leave the United States"" as part of a broader initiative by the Trump administration to implement mass deportations. This directive conflicts with a previous court order from Judge Robert Lasnik, which restricted their travel as part of their bail conditions. In February, Potapenko and Turogin admitted to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, acknowledging their role in defrauding Hashflare users of over $550 million between 2015 and 2019. They also raised $25 million from investors in 2017 under the pretense of creating a digital bank called Polybius, which was never established. Following their indictment in October 2022, the pair were arrested in Estonia and extradited to the U.S. in May 2024. They have been out on bail since July 2024 but face potential sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The situation has been further complicated by the DHS letters, which have reportedly been sent to thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. legally using the CBP One app. Some U.S. citizens have also received similar letters as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's deportation efforts. Mark Bini, a defense attorney for Potapenko and Turogin, expressed concern over the conflicting directives from federal authorities, noting the legal predicament it creates for his clients, who are required to comply with both the law and their bail conditions. Bini speculated that the U.S. government might be suggesting that Potapenko and Turogin ""self-deport"" to Estonia, following a Justice Department memo indicating a potential shift in enforcement policy for crypto-related criminal cases. The co-founders were expected to remain in the U.S. until at least August 14 for their sentencing hearings. To navigate this legal ambiguity, Potapenko and Turogin now carry letters indicating that DHS has deferred action on their ""self-deportation"" for one year, should authorities attempt to detain them. Despite the possibility of prison sentences, the co-founders have returned $400 million in crypto payments to users and agreed to forfeit assets frozen by the government in 2022. Bini hopes to persuade the judge to allow his clients to return to Estonia, arguing that there was no actual financial harm to Hashflare's customers.",04-22-2025

Binance,"OpenAI Faces Unexpected Costs Due to Polite Interactions with ChatGPT
According to ShibDaily, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has disclosed that the use of polite language in interactions with ChatGPT, such as including ""please"" and ""thank you,"" has led to a significant expense for the company. In a recent exchange on X, Altman responded to a query about the financial impact of users incorporating these courteous terms in their communications with AI models. He estimated the cost at ""tens of millions of dollars,"" but emphasized that it was ""well spent,"" indicating that the politeness reflects a positive trend in human-AI engagement. Altman humorously remarked, ""you never know,"" referencing the science fiction trope of sentient AI, a theme often explored in literature and film. His comments were met with humor from the tech and AI communities, who suggested maintaining politeness toward AI might be prudent, considering potential future developments reminiscent of fictional scenarios. The billing system for large language models like ChatGPT is based on token usage, charging by the number of words or characters processed. Longer prompts increase computational costs, as each interaction requires processing and generating tokens, including both user input and model output. With millions of users adding extra words to their inputs, the total token count rises, driving up operational expenses. As AI adoption grows, developers and users may need to reconsider their engagement strategies—balancing politeness with efficiency. In early April, OpenAI filed a countersuit against Elon Musk, the owner of X, escalating a legal battle that began when Musk initiated legal action against the company the previous week. The lawsuit, filed on April 9 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, accuses Musk of attempting to restructure OpenAI as a public benefit corporation while retaining its for-profit model. It also claims Musk distanced himself from OpenAI after it rejected a proposed merger with Tesla, his electric vehicle and clean energy company. Additionally, the lawsuit alleges Musk did not fulfill a $1 billion funding commitment to OpenAI. Following the launch of ChatGPT, Musk established a rival AI venture, xAI, marking a significant shift in his involvement with the AI research community. A jury trial to resolve the legal dispute between OpenAI and Musk is scheduled for the spring of 2026, representing the latest chapter in the ongoing conflict between the tech entrepreneur and the AI research firm.",04-22-2025

According to PANews, Web3 security firm GoPlus reported on the X platform that the Ethereum-based DeFi project R0AR experienced a security breach on April 16, resulting in a theft of approximately $780,000. The incident was attributed to a backdoor in the project's contract. The project team released an incident report today, stating that the stolen funds have been recovered, although the addresses and transaction hashes have not yet been disclosed. This incident serves as a reminder for users to be cautious of backdoor contracts, specifically warning against interacting with contract 0xBD2Cd7. The R0ARStaking contract was found to have a backdoor from the time of its deployment. A malicious address, 0x8149f, was pre-configured with a significant amount of $1R0R tokens available for extraction. The attacker initially conducted small deposit() and harvest() transactions to prepare for a malicious EmergencyWithdraw() operation. According to the contract's code logic, since the rewardAmount exceeded the r0arTokenBalance (the contract's balance), the rewardAmount was set to the contract's token balance. Consequently, all tokens within the contract were transferred to the malicious address 0x8149f. Similarly, all LP tokens from the LP Token contract were also transferred to the same address. Finally, the userInfo.amount was set to zero. The userInfo in the contract is a mapping structure, with its address dynamically calculated using the key (uid and msg.sender) hash. This suggests that the backdoor was premeditated, with the malicious address calculated before the contract's deployment.",04-22-2025

Binance,"Cryptocurrency ETPs Show Signs of Recovery Amid Mixed Investor Sentiment
According to Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) experienced a slight recovery last week, with minor inflows following significant outflows exceeding $1 billion in the preceding two weeks. Crypto investment products recorded modest inflows of $6 million during the week of April 14–18, indicating mixed investor sentiment, as reported by CoinShares on April 22. The week began with minor inflows, but stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales figures mid-week likely triggered outflows amounting to $146 million, according to James Butterfill, CoinShares’ head of research. Total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs increased by 1.4%, rising from approximately $129 billion on April 11 to $131 billion by April 18. Despite the minor inflows, all U.S. crypto ETP issuers remain in the red for the month of April. BlackRock’s iShares exchange-traded funds experienced the largest inflows last week, totaling $182 million, while major issuers like Fidelity faced outflows of $123 million from their crypto ETPs. Bitwise was among the few U.S. issuers that saw inflows, totaling $24 million, whereas the European issuer 21Shares recorded larger inflows of $37 million. Notably, 21Shares was the only issuer to maintain $28 million of inflows in April. Year-to-date, BlackRock’s iShares ETFs have been robust, with over $3 billion in inflows. Most issuers remain in the red, except for Proshares, which has seen $340 million in inflows, and Cathie Wood’s ARK, with $19 million YTD. Asset-wise, Ether (ETH) experienced the largest ETP outflows among cryptocurrencies last week, totaling $26.7 million. Conversely, XRP (XRP) stood out with significant inflows of $37.7 million, marking it as the biggest gainer among crypto ETPs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin saw minor outflows of $6 million, extending April outflows to $894 million. Despite this, Bitcoin still holds $541 million in ETP inflows YTD, leading before Ether and XRP, which have $215 million and $214 million YTD, respectively.",04-22-2025

Binance,"XRP Poised for Potential Breakout Amid Whale Accumulation
According to Cointelegraph, XRP has been trading within a narrow range over the past eight days, maintaining its position just above the $2.00 support level following a marketwide recovery over the weekend. Onchain and technical data suggest that the XRP/USD pair is positioned for a potential breakout toward the $3.00 mark. Since April 14, XRP's price has been consolidating between $2.03 and $2.13, with the daily relative strength index (RSI) remaining flat at approximately 49, indicating market indecision. Despite this sideways movement, whale activity presents a promising outlook, as onchain data reveals that large investors have capitalized on the price drop to $1.61. Notably, XRP whale addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have seen a sharp increase since April 1, according to Santiment data. Similarly, addresses holding over 1 billion XRP have steadily grown, now accounting for 39.37% of the total XRP supply, up from 37.67% at the end of March. This trend may reflect the confidence of these large investors in XRP's potential price increase, despite prevailing macroeconomic risks and uncertainties. Additionally, XRP has experienced a notable decline in exchange reserves. The XRP balance on exchanges peaked at 3.27 billion XRP in November 2024, but currently, around 2.7 million XRP are held on exchanges. This metric has decreased by 10% over the past 30 days, despite market turbulence since early April. The price action between April 7 and April 22 has resulted in the formation of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart, with the price retesting the upper trendline of the flag at $2.10, suggesting a possible breakout. Although the price has unsuccessfully attempted to rise above this trendline multiple times in the last ten days, each retest has led to new buyers accumulating around this region. A decisive close above this trendline could enable XRP to recover from its current level and potentially break out toward the flag's technical target at $2.93 or the $3.00 psychological level, provided strong volume supports the move. Several analysts have echoed this bullish outlook, viewing XRP's consolidation as a precursor to a significant upward move. Popular trader Dark Defender noted that XRP is retesting a key multimonth resistance line, suggesting that if this resistance is broken, the price could break out, with Wave 5 potentially driving it toward $4.00. Key levels to monitor include $2.22 and $2.75 on the upside and $1.80 and $1.61 on the downside, according to the analyst. Meanwhile, fellow trader CasiTrades indicated that the rejection at $2.24 suggests the price may sweep major support levels around $1.90 or $1.55 before XRP is ready to break out. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Wyckoff reaccumulation and falling wedge patterns are painting a bullish target for XRP above $3.50.

Former BitMEX CEO Links Bitcoin Positioning to Anticipated Bond Yield SpikeArthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, has raised concerns over the rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen, warning that it could pose systemic risks to leveraged positions in U.S. stocks and bonds.According to a report by Foresight News, Hayes believes the current macro landscape — marked by the yen’s unexpected strength — may force heavily leveraged traders in U.S. markets to unwind risk exposures, especially as pressure mounts on equity and bond portfolios.Trump’s Weak-Dollar Push Meets Strong-Yen RealityHayes pointed out the disconnect between former President Donald Trump’s pro-weak-dollar stance and the current market dynamics.

Binance,"Gold's Surge Sparks Debate Over Its Role as Money Amid Economic Concerns
According to Cointelegraph, the recent surge in gold prices, surpassing $3,500, has reignited discussions about its role as money, particularly among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Peter Schiff, a well-known advocate for gold and critic of Bitcoin, emphasized that gold is not merely a commodity but actual money. His comments, shared in a post on April 22, came as gold prices briefly exceeded $3,500, prompting a mixed response from the crypto community. Schiff's remarks also highlighted concerns about the U.S. economy, suggesting that the significant rise in gold prices could signal troubling times for the U.S. dollar. He warned that the dominance of the U.S. dollar might be waning, predicting significant changes in American life. This year, gold has seen a 31.6% increase in value, while the U.S. Dollar Index has dropped over 9%, according to TradingView data. Despite the surge in gold futures, spot gold has yet to reach the $3,500 mark, peaking at $3,498. The debate over gold's status as money has gained traction on social media, with many questioning its practicality as a payment method. Critics argue that gold does not fulfill the essential functions of money, particularly as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency supporters, like Mike Alfred, have pointed out the impracticality of using gold for everyday transactions, contrasting it with the ease of using digital currencies like Bitcoin. Alfred humorously noted that he attempted to use gold at a Starbucks, highlighting its rarity as a payment method. The ongoing discussion has also fueled the narrative of gold versus Bitcoin, often referred to as ""digital gold."" Prominent figures like Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Invest, argue that Bitcoin represents a more significant concept than gold, with the potential to tap into gold's $23 trillion market. However, some believe that gold and Bitcoin should not be viewed as direct competitors, given their distinct characteristics and purposes.

Ethereum followed with $19.2 million in NFT sales, while Mythos Chain and Bitcoin-based collections recorded sales of $14.3 million and $14.1 million, respectively.

A policy document reveals that the ECB is advocating for revisions to the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, which came into effect months ago. The central issue of the debate is the concern that U.S. reforms, backed by President Trump, could lead to an influx of dollar-denominated stablecoins into the European market. The ECB fears this could trigger capital flight from Europe to U.S. assets, undermining EU financial sovereignty and exposing banks to liquidity risks.

Binance,"Metaplex Faces Criticism Over Unclaimed Solana Funds Plan
According to Cointelegraph, the Solana-based non-fungible token platform Metaplex is under scrutiny from crypto law firm Burwick Law regarding its plan to transfer unclaimed Solana (SOL) into its treasury instead of returning it to investors. Burwick Law has suggested that Metaplex could face litigation if it proceeds with this plan. Last year, Metaplex discovered a method to reduce on-chain storage for certain NFTs, allowing Solana NFT holders to claim a small amount of SOL. In October, Metaplex announced that holders of Metaplex Token Metadata (TM) NFTs could execute a “resize optimization” for all TM accounts by April 25. Those who did not voluntarily resize by the deadline would have their excess SOL automatically transferred to the Metaplex DAO, with the use of these funds yet to be determined. Burwick Law criticized Metaplex's decision to sweep unclaimed funds into its DAO treasury rather than returning them to NFT holders. In an open letter dated April 22, Burwick expressed concerns that many minters were not adequately informed that these lamports could be swept and diverted to a treasury they do not control. The firm highlighted that over 54,000 SOL tokens are at risk, with only 7,043 SOL claimed according to Metaplex’s website. At current market prices, this leaves more than $6.5 million unclaimed. Burwick stated that many NFT collectors it represents have expressed significant concerns about the plan, arguing that it undermines trust and violates the spirit of cryptocurrency. The firm emphasized that the principle of 'code is law' only holds when rules are clear and immutable, warning that if a protocol can alter agreements retrospectively, the promise of decentralized permanence becomes meaningless. Burwick Law further suggested that victims could be entitled to restitution if a court finds the sweep constitutes unjust enrichment or violates consumer protection laws. Metaplex has not responded to Burwick’s post on X, and Cointelegraph's attempts to reach Metaplex for comment were unsuccessful. Metaplex has indicated that the unclaimed SOL may be used for DAO initiatives such as voting on airdrops, distributing grants to ecosystem builders, or other projects. Burwick Law proposed that Metaplex should pause its plan and refund rent directly to current NFT holders while retaining a modest network-maintenance bounty of 10%. This approach, according to Burwick, would protect users, preserve DAO funding, and demonstrate that the Solana ecosystem can self-regulate without legal intervention. The firm noted that other DeFi protocols have resolved similar issues in this manner and urged Metaplex to adopt this strategy to avoid litigation and potential fund freezing. Burwick concluded by stating that the responsibility lies with the DAO to demonstrate that Web3 can correct its course and adhere to its founding principles of transparency, immutability, and fair dealing.",04-22-2025

Binance,"Proposed Legislation Targets Crypto Tax Haven Status in Puerto Rico
According to Cointelegraph, a new legislative proposal aims to address the use of Puerto Rico as a tax haven for cryptocurrency investors. New York Representative Nydia Velázquez has introduced the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act, which seeks to amend existing laws to ensure that certain investors pay both local and federal taxes on capital gains, including those from digital assets. This proposed legislation would modify Puerto Rico’s Internal Revenue Code to align income from cryptocurrencies with federal tax regulations. Rep. Velázquez expressed concerns that the influx of crypto investors has not contributed positively to Puerto Rico’s economic recovery or local economy. Instead, she argues, it has led to increased housing costs, displacement of local residents, and added financial strain on an island where nearly 40% of the population lives in poverty. Additionally, the federal government is reportedly losing billions in tax revenue due to these tax incentives. Puerto Rico has been a popular destination for crypto investors since 2012, when the territory began offering tax exemptions under Act 20 and Act 22, later consolidated as Act 60. This has attracted notable figures in the crypto industry, including Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead, venture capitalist Brock Pierce, and influencer Logan Paul. The office of Rep. Velázquez estimates that Puerto Rico could lose approximately $4.5 billion in revenue from 2020 to 2026 due to these tax incentives. In contrast, Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González-Colón has proposed extending Act 60, which is set to expire in 2035, to 2055. Her proposal includes a 4% capital gains tax rate for applicants, significantly lower than the typical U.S. rate of up to 37%. However, it remains uncertain whether Rep. Velázquez’s proposed legislation will garner sufficient political support to pass in the Republican-controlled House or Senate. Both chambers are expected to consider votes on stablecoin legislation and a broader crypto regulatory framework in the coming months.",04-21-2025

According to Cointelegraph, El Salvador, the pioneering nation in adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, is collaborating with Nvidia to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into its national development strategy. The National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC) of El Salvador announced on April 21 that a letter of intent has been signed with Nvidia to develop 'sovereign AI' aimed at fostering innovation and economic growth. This partnership will leverage Nvidia's AI tools, resources, and expertise to enhance El Salvador's capabilities in areas such as culture, language, environment, and economy. The collaboration focuses on building domestic AI infrastructure, enhancing workforce skills, and creating solutions to address local challenges. These include improving healthcare delivery, advancing education, and boosting economic productivity. El Salvador's commitment to AI is evident in its plans to establish training programs for developers, researchers, and government officials, ensuring the nation possesses the talent necessary to sustain its AI ambitions. One practical application of this initiative is the development of AI-driven models for weather and rainfall forecasting, which will aid in emergency response, protect residents in landslide-prone areas, and optimize hydroelectric power management. This partnership with Nvidia is part of a broader AI-focused strategy in El Salvador. In March 2025, the ONBTC launched CUBO_ai, a university-level public education program, which is the only national initiative of its kind bringing in top-tier experts. Supported by prominent Bitcoin advocate Cathie Wood, who is set to deliver the program's inaugural lecture, CUBO_ai underscores El Salvador's dedication to integrating AI into its educational framework. Despite these advancements in AI, El Salvador's Bitcoin initiatives have faced challenges.

According to Cointelegraph, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has voiced significant concerns regarding the increasing threat to private messaging in France and other European Union countries. He warned that Telegram might withdraw from certain markets rather than compromise user privacy by implementing encryption backdoors. In a post dated April 21 on his Telegram channel, Durov expressed alarm over the EU's efforts to weaken messaging encryption by introducing backdoors, which would allow authorities to bypass encryption and access private user data. Durov emphasized Telegram's dedication to digital privacy, citing initiatives from French and EU lawmakers that would require messaging apps like Telegram to implement backdoors for police access. He stated, ""Telegram would rather exit a market than undermine encryption with backdoors and violate basic human rights,"" and criticized competitors who trade privacy for market share. Durov highlighted the risks associated with encryption backdoors, noting that they could be exploited not only by authorities but also by hackers and foreign agents. He explained, ""It's technically impossible to guarantee that only the police can access a backdoor,"" warning that such measures would compromise users' private messages. He further noted that criminals might resort to lesser-known apps and use virtual private networks (VPNs) to evade detection, rendering such regulations ineffective. Despite complying with valid court orders in some jurisdictions, Telegram has never disclosed private messages. Durov stated, ""In its 12-year history, Telegram has never disclosed a single byte of private messages. In accordance with the EU Digital Services Act, if provided with a valid court order, Telegram would only disclose the IP addresses and phone numbers of criminal suspects — not messages."" He urged privacy advocates to continue engaging with lawmakers to promote encryption as a tool for protecting privacy and safety for ordinary people, rather than viewing it as a criminal tool. Although the French National Assembly rejected a proposal to allow hidden access to private messages in March, Durov warned that the EU's battle against digital privacy is far from over. He referenced the European Commission's ""ProtectEU"" proposal from early April, which aims to find ""technological solutions to enable lawful access to data by law enforcement authorities in 2026."" The proposal has faced criticism from digital privacy advocates and some European lawmakers, with Finnish MEP Aura Salla arguing that introducing encryption backdoors ""fundamentally undermines the very cybersecurity principles ProtectEU aims to uphold."" Durov concluded by stating, ""No country is immune to the slow erosion of freedoms. Every day, those freedoms come under attack — and every day, we must defend them."" His warning about threats to privacy and freedom in the EU coincides with an ongoing legal case in France against him, centered around allegations of facilitating a platform that enables illicit transactions. French prosecutors have indicated that Durov could face up to 10 years in prison and a $550,000 fine if convicted.",04-21-2025

Binance,"Ethereum Foundation Prioritizes User Experience and Scaling Amid Leadership Changes
According to Cointelegraph, the Ethereum Foundation is redirecting its focus towards enhancing user experience and addressing layer-1 scaling challenges following a recent leadership transition. On April 21, Tomasz Stańczak, co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, shared insights on social media about the organization's evolving priorities post-leadership restructuring. The shift aims to allow Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin more time for research and exploration, freeing him from daily operational tasks and crisis management. Stańczak emphasized that Buterin's insights and directional guidance have historically accelerated significant long-term breakthroughs within the Ethereum ecosystem. The leadership changes, announced on March 1, saw Hsiao-Wei Wang and Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, appointed as co-directors effective March 17. Since then, Buterin has stepped back from daily operations, focusing instead on proposals to enhance the Ethereum network's privacy and performance. On April 11, Buterin introduced a privacy roadmap, suggesting features that anonymize user transactions, ideally activated by default. Additionally, on April 20, he proposed modifications to the Ethereum Virtual Machine's contract language to boost the blockchain's execution layer efficiency and speed. Stańczak noted that while Buterin's proposals are influential, they are intended to spark discussions and foster progress across various research domains, allowing the community to refine or reject these ideas. The Ethereum Foundation is now concentrating its research efforts on ""near-term"" objectives, including improving user experience and scaling challenges in forthcoming protocol upgrades. Stańczak highlighted the foundation's focus on layer-1 scaling, support for layer-2 scaling, and user experience enhancements such as interoperability in the Pectra, Fusaka, and Glamsterdam upgrades.

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Breaks $87K as Dollar Sinks on Reports Trump Aims to Oust Fed Chair Powell
BTC and Gold Surge Amid Rising Concerns Over Federal Reserve IndependenceBitcoin jumped past $87,200 on Monday, hitting its highest level since early April as the U.S. dollar index (DXY) plunged to a three-year low, following reports that former President Donald Trump is exploring options to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.BTC rallied over 2% during early Asian hours, outpacing major altcoins including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Cardano (ADA), which posted more modest gains of around 1%. The move marked a bullish breakout from the consolidation zone between $83,000 and $87,000 that has held since early April.Dollar Index Falls to 98.5 as Traders React to Fed Shakeup SpeculationIn foreign exchange markets, hedge funds and institutional traders aggressively sold the U.S. dollar against the euro, yen, and Australian dollar, pushing the DXY to 98.5, its lowest point since April 2022. The dollar has now declined by 10% over the past three months, reflecting growing concerns over central bank credibility and economic uncertainty.“The move in Bitcoin to $87,000 appears to be driven by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar and a 2% rally in gold, both triggered by Trump’s push to replace Fed Chair Powell,” said Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research.Gold Hits New All-Time High as Investors Seek SafetySafe-haven demand also drove gold prices to a record $3,382 per ounce, pushing its year-to-date gains to 28%. Analysts say the simultaneous surge in gold and Bitcoin underscores growing investor unease about monetary policy stability in the U.S.“Gold and Bitcoin are moving in tandem again — signaling market fears over inflation, rate policy, and now political pressure on the Fed,” noted one macro strategist.Trump’s Remarks Stir Market AnxietyReports began circulating late last week that Trump is exploring legal avenues to terminate Powell if re-elected. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough,” renewing his long-standing criticism of high interest rates and the Fed’s cautious stance.Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee responded on Sunday, warning that such a move would undermine the Fed’s credibility and independence, potentially spooking global markets further.Powell, for his part, reiterated last week that the Federal Reserve would remain data-dependent before any rate adjustments, but warned that the risk of stagflation is rising — a sentiment that could further complicate monetary policy heading into election season.",04-21-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Whales Quietly Accumulate as Price Climbs Back Toward $90K
Over 60 New Whale Wallets Emerge in April Amid Market DipBitcoin’s recent price correction hasn’t scared off the big players. On the contrary, new data shows that whale accumulation is ramping up, with over 60 new wallets holding 1,000 BTC or more added since early March.According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the number of these large Bitcoin holders jumped from 2,037 in late February to 2,107 by April 15, marking a four-month high. This level of accumulation hasn’t been seen since the surges around Trump’s election win in late 2024.Whale Wallets Climb While Retail Activity SlowsWhile whales are aggressively stacking, smaller holders appear to be stepping back. Wallets holding fewer than 10 BTC have seen a slow decline in recent months. Meanwhile, addresses holding over 100 BTC have slightly increased, reaching 18,026 as of April 20.This divergence suggests a growing gap in market behaviour — with long-term, deep-pocketed investors showing strong conviction, while retail sentiment cools.Whales Absorb Over 300% of Annual BTC IssuanceOn April 18, Cointelegraph reported that whales were absorbing Bitcoin at rates exceeding 300% of the annual BTC issuance, putting additional pressure on supply while exchange reserves continue to shrink.Glassnode data confirms that wallets holding over 10,000 BTC remain in aggressive accumulation mode.

Binance,"Trump's Pressure on Fed May Influence Rate Decisions, Expert Says
According to BlockBeats, Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, has expressed skepticism about U.S. President Donald Trump's likelihood of following through on his threat to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Despite this, Bianchi notes that Trump's public campaign to push for interest rate cuts could still exert pressure on the Fed's decision-making process. Following Trump's threat last week, the Fed is aware that it could be blamed publicly if an economic recession occurs.Powell has made it clear that he is not in a hurry to lower interest rates, prompting Trump to suggest the possibility of firing him. This exchange led to a significant drop in the stock market, as concerns grew over the potential weakening of the Fed's independence. Bianchi believes Trump will not act on his threat, primarily because Powell's term is set to end in about a year. The chaos that would ensue from replacing Powell would outweigh any potential benefits, and such a move could lead financial markets to anticipate further interest rate hikes.",04-21-2025

According to Cointelegraph, a Solana-based NFT initiative, Dead Bruv, is set to launch a unique project involving the sale of 100,000 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to fund the purchase of a Cold War-era nuclear bunker located in Rutland, England. The creators of the narrative-driven NFT project, Meatbags, plan to mint these NFTs, with 10,000 being airdropped to current Meatbags holders. The remaining NFTs will be available for purchase starting April 21, priced at $14 each, as announced on the Meatbags X account.The NFT holders will gain access to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) named the Billionaire Bunker Club. This DAO is described as a ""fully decentralized, community-governed real-world asset onchain,"" which will have the authority to decide the future use of the bunker if the acquisition is successful. Proposed ideas for the bunker include transforming it into a ""members-only survival resort with Doomsday DJ,"" hosting end-of-the-world festivals, or converting it into an Airbnb offering caviar tastings and canned bean room service.The bunker, listed by UK online auctioneer SDL Property Auctions, has a guide price of 650,000 British pounds ($862,257) and is scheduled for auction on April 24. The property is situated on 1.4 acres near a former reservoir and has the necessary permissions for conversion into a residential house. Originally constructed in 1960 as a monitoring post during the Cold War, the bunker was decommissioned in 1968. It was one of 1,500 bunkers tasked with reporting nuclear bursts and monitoring radioactive fallout, as noted by SDL Property Auctions.Robert, the pseudonymous co-founder of Dead Bruv, explained in an April 18 statement to X that the initiative began as a joke but evolved into a serious endeavor aimed at ""making NFTs fun again.""

According to PANews, a recent article by OKG Research published in Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao highlights the current challenges faced by the Real World Asset (RWA) ecosystem, particularly the bottleneck of mainstream asset tokenization leading to stagnation. While standardized assets like U.S. Treasury bonds provide a certain starting point for RWAs, their on-chain transformation is largely a technical encapsulation that fails to unlock structural value.The future of RWAs lies in activating 'silent assets'—those long excluded from traditional financial systems, difficult to value, and lacking liquidity. By tokenizing these assets, their value can be expressed and freely circulated, creating new market dynamics. This transformation could make RWAs an attractive investment opportunity, drawing diverse funding on-chain and achieving a dual transformation from 'asset end' to 'funding end.'OKG Research also suggests that Hong Kong, as a globally RWA-friendly policy hub, should actively pilot projects in non-standard and data assets. This would position Hong Kong as a global testing ground for 'multi-asset structured RWAs,' rather than merely serving as an issuance center and channel relay in the RWA value chain.",04-21-2025

According to Cointelegraph, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently highlighted the financial implications of users sending polite messages to ChatGPT, estimating the cost at tens of millions of dollars. Altman shared this insight on April 16, responding to a query on X, sparking a broader discussion about the motivations behind courteous interactions with AI models. The conversation has revealed varied reasons for such behavior. Some users express politeness towards AI with the belief that if AI becomes sentient, it might treat individuals based on past interactions. Engineer Carl Youngblood emphasizes treating AI with courtesy as a moral imperative, suggesting that it aids personal development and prevents the deterioration of interpersonal skills. A survey conducted by Future in December 2024 found that 67% of American users are polite to AI assistants, with 55% doing so because they believe it's the right thing to do, while 12% act out of fear that mistreating AI could have future consequences. The debate extends to ChatGPT's electricity consumption, with a September 2023 research paper by Digiconomist founder Alex de Vries estimating that a single query requires around three watt-hours of electricity. However, Josh You, a data analyst from Epoch AI, argues that this figure is an overestimate, suggesting it is closer to 0.3 watt-hours due to advancements in models and hardware efficiency. Amidst these discussions, Altman noted that AI output costs have been decreasing tenfold annually as models become more efficient. Despite these challenges, OpenAI anticipates significant revenue growth, projecting a more than threefold increase this year to $12.7 billion, even as competition intensifies from companies like China's DeepSeek. However, OpenAI does not expect to achieve cash-flow positivity until 2029, when it forecasts revenues to exceed $125 billion.

Binance,"Ethereum's Future: Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V for Enhanced Efficiency
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has put forward a proposal to replace the current Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) contract language with the RISC-V instruction set architecture. This change aims to enhance the speed and efficiency of Ethereum's execution layer. Buterin's proposal, dated April 20, addresses several long-term challenges in scaling the Ethereum network, such as stable data availability sampling, maintaining competitive block production, and zero-knowledge EVM proving. Buterin argues that adopting the RISC-V architecture in smart contracts could keep block production markets competitive and improve the efficiency of zero-knowledge functions within the execution layer. He emphasized that while the beam chain effort shows promise in simplifying Ethereum's consensus layer, a radical change like this might be necessary for the execution layer to achieve similar improvements. The proposal underscores Ethereum's ongoing struggle to enhance throughput and remain competitive with newer monolithic blockchains like Solana and Sui, especially as investor confidence in the original smart contract blockchain wanes. Buterin suggests that implementing this proposal could result in efficiency gains of up to 100 times. Meanwhile, Ethereum's network fees have seen a significant decline. During the week of March 30, Ethereum's blob fees, which are transaction fees from Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, fell to a weekly low of 3.18 Ether (ETH), equivalent to approximately $5,000 based on current Ether prices. In April 2025, Ethereum network fees reached their lowest levels since 2020, averaging around $0.16 per transaction. Brian Quinlivan, Santiment's marketing director, attributes the dramatic reduction in fees to a decrease in users sending transactions on the Ethereum base layer. Instead, users are opting for smart contracts or one of Ethereum's numerous layer-2 scaling solutions. The decline in Ethereum network weekly transaction fees was notable in the first quarter of 2025. While layer-2 networks have significantly reduced transaction costs on the base layer, they have also impacted Ethereum's base layer revenue. This has raised concerns about revenue generation and the potential negative effects of layer-2 scaling solutions on Ethereum's market share. As a result, Ether's price has reached historic lows and could fall further to around $1,100 if investor confidence continues to decline.",04-20-2025

According to Cointelegraph, Dogecoin enthusiasts worldwide marked ""Dogeday"" on April 20, an unofficial holiday celebrated by the memecoin community. This event coincides with International Weed Day and has been observed since 2021. As Dogecoin holders celebrate, they are also keenly awaiting the upcoming deadlines for exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications related to Dogecoin. Despite its origins as a joke token, Dogecoin has maintained its position as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $23.3 billion, as reported by CoinMarketCap. The tokenomics of Dogecoin have faced criticism due to the issuance of 14.4 million new DOGE into circulation daily, resulting in a daily inflation rate exceeding $2.16 million. Anndy Lian, an author and intergovernmental blockchain expert, attributes Dogecoin's resilience to a combination of community-driven enthusiasm, low entry barriers, and speculative appeal. Lian notes that Dogecoin's inflationary supply, which adds approximately 5 billion coins annually, keeps prices accessible, typically under $1, making it attractive to retail investors. The memecoin's branding, driven by memes, resonates particularly with younger, internet-savvy investors. The Dogecoin community is closely monitoring the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it considers several DOGE-related ETF applications. Currently, there are four Dogecoin ETF filings awaiting approval: the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF, the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF, the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF, and the Osprey Fund Dogecoin ETF. Grayscale's ETF application is due for a response on May 21, following a delay by the SEC on multiple crypto ETF filings.

Binance,"Bitcoin Dominance Expected to Rise Further, Says Jan3 CEO
According to Cointelegraph, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow has expressed confidence that Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market has not yet reached its peak. Mow's analysis suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for further growth, surpassing the expectations of many crypto analysts who predicted a plateau by late 2024. In an April 19 post on X, Mow highlighted the impact of 'unit bias'—a psychological tendency where investors prefer owning whole units of cheaper altcoins over fractional Bitcoin ownership. This bias, he argues, leads less experienced investors to mistakenly perceive altcoins as better value. Mow challenges the valuation of altcoins by proposing a scenario where unit bias is removed, allowing for a direct comparison with Bitcoin's supply. He illustrates that if altcoins were evaluated on an equal footing with Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap, Ether (ETH) would be valued at $9,200, XRP at $5,800, and Solana (SOL) at $3,400. These figures represent significant increases from their current market prices, according to CoinMarketCap data. Mow asserts that such valuations are unrealistic for these altcoins. Sunny Po, an anonymous Bitcoin advocate, echoed Mow's sentiments, stating that unit bias is a fundamental mindset among novice investors who equate lower prices with better value. Mow further explained that many altcoins exploit this bias by maintaining a high total supply, making it difficult for investors to assess their true value. Mow's calculations indicate that Bitcoin dominance is set to rise significantly. Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures Bitcoin's share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, is a key indicator for traders to assess potential price peaks. Historically, a decline in Bitcoin dominance often signals the onset of an altcoin season, where capital shifts from Bitcoin to altcoins in search of higher returns. Currently, Bitcoin dominance has increased by 9.11% over the past six months, standing at 63.66% according to TradingView data. This rise contradicts earlier forecasts by several crypto analysts who anticipated Bitcoin dominance to peak at 60% by late 2024, preceding an altcoin season. In August 2024, Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, stated that he did not expect Bitcoin dominance to reach 70%, setting his target at 60% instead.",04-20-2025

Binance,"Market Volatility Increases Amid Fed Leadership Concerns
According to PANews, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq indices have both fallen by over 2% this week, while the S&P 500 has seen a 1.5% decline. This downturn is attributed to investor disappointment with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's stance on central bank support for the market.

Binance,"XRP Faces Potential Correction Amid Bearish Patterns and Market Sentiment
According to Cointelegraph, XRP has experienced a notable rebound of nearly 30% after hitting a four-month low of $1.61, driven by rising tariff tensions. However, this recovery may be short-lived as technical patterns and on-chain signals suggest a deeper correction could be imminent. The cryptocurrency is currently forming a classic bearish reversal pattern known as the inverse cup-and-handle (IC&H), which could result in a price drop of at least 40% in the coming weeks. This pattern typically emerges when the price rounds off in a curved descent, followed by a brief consolidation phase, all atop a common neckline support level. As of April 19, XRP has entered the handle-formation phase, with a potential decisive close below the neckline support at around $2. If this occurs, the primary downside target is likely to be around $1.24, which is almost 40% below current prices. This target aligns with XRP’s 200-3D exponential moving average (EMA) at approximately $1.28, coinciding with a November 2024 peak. Additionally, veteran trader Peter Brandt has indicated that XRP’s market cap could decrease by 50% in the coming weeks. The inverse cup-and-handle pattern is unfolding in line with XRP’s historical price behavior, signaling that its 2025 rally may have reached its peak. In previous cycles, the cryptocurrency experienced sharp pullbacks to its aggregated realized price following major surges, notably in 2018 and 2021. The realized price serves as a psychological benchmark for traders, representing the average price at which the XRP supply was last moved. When the market price trades significantly above this level, most holders are in profit, which can lead to complacency or profit-taking. Conversely, if the price approaches the realized price, fear of losses tends to rise, intensifying selling pressure. In 2025, XRP surged past $3.20 before losing momentum, repeating patterns seen in past bull-to-bear cycles. The current realized price is around $1, a likely downside target in 2025, approximately 50% below current prices. Interestingly, XRP’s $1 realized price target is closer to its 200-week EMA at $0.81, a bear market target discussed in Cointelegraph’s analysis in late March. Adding to the bearish outlook, over 80% of XRP addresses are currently in profit, a metric that historically reached similar levels during previous market tops, often preceding significant rounds of profit-taking and pullbacks. If history repeats, these conditions could incentivize traders to exit positions, accelerating XRP’s retracement toward the realized price. Sentiment around XRP reaching a new all-time high above the $3.55 level is deteriorating, according to prediction market data from Polymarket. As of April 19, the odds of XRP achieving this milestone before 2026 have dropped to just 35%, marking a sharp 25% decline from peak confidence levels in March. The upside momentum in the crypto market has faded overall in April, coinciding with a broader decline in risk appetite driven by escalating global tariff tensions under U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

Binance,"Slovenia Proposes 25% Tax on Cryptocurrency Gains Starting 2026

Funding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between contract prices and the prices of underlying assets, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the platform charging this fee. It adjusts the cost or yield of holding contracts to keep contract prices close to the asset prices. A funding rate of 0.01% signifies a baseline rate.

According to Cointelegraph, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has issued a stark warning regarding the potential consequences if U.S. President Donald Trump decides to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Warren cautioned that such a move could severely undermine investor confidence in the integrity of U.S. capital markets, potentially triggering a financial crash. During an interview on CNBC, the Massachusetts Senator emphasized that the President lacks the legal authority to remove Powell from his position. She further argued that removing Powell would weaken the financial infrastructure of the United States. Warren stated, ""If Chairman Powell can be fired by the President of the United States, it will crash the markets. The infrastructure that keeps this stock market strong and, therefore, a big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics."" She added that if U.S. interest rates were subject to the whims of a president, it would erode the distinction between the U.S. and less stable political systems.President Trump has been vocal about his dissatisfaction with Powell, primarily due to the chairman's reluctance to lower interest rates. Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's termination, arguing that lower interest rates could serve as a positive catalyst for risk-on asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. This, he believes, could help reverse the market downturn caused by the ongoing trade war and current macroeconomic pressures. Trump's criticism of Powell intensified following an April 17 post on Truth Social, where he reiterated his desire to remove the chairman. This has fueled speculation about whether Trump will act on his threats. Senator Rick Scott has echoed Trump's sentiments, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Federal Reserve's leadership. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Scott wrote, ""It’s time to clean house of everyone working at the Federal Reserve who isn’t on board with helping the American people and fighting for their best interests.""The Trump administration has consistently prioritized lowering interest rates. Market analyst Anthony Pompliano recently speculated that Trump might have intentionally destabilized financial markets to pressure for lower rates. Pompliano pointed to a reduction in the yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond to 4% as evidence. However, the yield has since increased to 4.3%. The ongoing debate over interest rates and the Federal Reserve's independence continues to be a contentious issue, with significant implications for both domestic and global economies.",04-18-2025
Binance,"Former Wall Street Executive Charged with Investor Fraud in Crypto Casino Venture
According to ShibDaily, Richard Kim, a former executive at prominent Wall Street firms, has been charged by federal prosecutors with defrauding investors in his startup crypto casino, Zero Edge. The government alleges that Kim solicited over $7 million under false pretenses and misappropriated the funds, losing most through high-risk trades and gambling. Kim, who previously held positions at Galaxy Digital, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase, was arrested on Tuesday, as detailed in court filings. The formal complaint, filed in the Southern District of New York, accuses Kim of wire fraud and securities fraud, allegedly occurring between March and July 2024. The FBI agent's sworn statement claims Kim devised a scheme to defraud investors. Zero Edge reportedly raised over $7 million, closing a seed round around June 20, after which the alleged misappropriation began. The FBI stated Kim lost nearly all of the funds, with initial reports indicating he admitted to losing at least $3.67 million shortly after funding closed, while prosecutors later cited a figure closer to $4.3 million. Kim attributed the losses to leveraged crypto trades during Bitcoin's June decline, citing a long-standing gambling addiction and a downward spiral. He expressed remorse, stating that after receiving the funds, he felt compelled to make up for his missteps. Kim's arrest contrasts sharply with his Wall Street and legal pedigree, having served as a general partner at Galaxy Interactive and held COO roles in trading divisions at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, as well as working as an attorney at Cleary Gottlieb. Galaxy Digital, an investor in Zero Edge, reported Kim's conduct to authorities upon learning of his actions, calling their own investment immaterial. In a July interview, Kim claimed he had proactively contacted the SEC, admitting his actions were grossly negligent but denying intent to steal.

Binance,"Trump Reinstates Schedule F to Restructure Federal Workforce
According to BlockBeats, U.S. President Donald Trump is reinstating the ""Schedule F"" initiative to streamline the process of dismissing federal employees. This plan aims to reclassify approximately 50,000 policy-related federal positions, representing 2% of the workforce, as ""at-will"" employment. This move is expected to weaken the protections traditionally afforded to U.S. civil servants, making it easier for the government to dismiss employees deemed ""disloyal."" The traditional U.S. federal civil service system provides job protection, preventing dismissals based on political reasons. By converting policy-making positions to ""at-will"" status, the Schedule F initiative challenges the 140-year-old Pendleton Act, which established the principle of a politically neutral civil service. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has instructed agencies to submit restructuring proposals by April 20. Critics argue that this action by the Trump administration could lead to a ""political purge"" within the government, undermining the professional civil service system. President Joe Biden had previously abolished this policy upon taking office, but Trump reinstated it through an executive order on his first day back in the White House.",04-18-2025

Binance,"Quantum Computing May Challenge Bitcoin's Security, Says Adam Back
According to Cointelegraph, early cypherpunk Adam Back, who was referenced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, has raised concerns about the potential impact of quantum computing on Bitcoin's security. During a recent interview following a Q&A session at the 'Satoshi Spritz' event in Turin on April 18, Back suggested that advancements in quantum computing could eventually compel Nakamoto to move their Bitcoin (BTC). This is because Bitcoin holders might need to transition their assets to newer, quantum-resistant signature-based addresses to safeguard them. Back emphasized that while current quantum computers do not pose an immediate threat to Bitcoin's cryptography, they could become a significant risk in the future, potentially within the next two decades. He explained that when this threat materializes, the Bitcoin community will face a critical decision: either deprecate old, vulnerable addresses or risk having those funds stolen. Back anticipates that the community will opt for the former, which would necessitate Nakamoto moving their funds to avoid potential loss. The discussion also touched on the role of privacy upgrades in this scenario. Back noted that the revelation of Nakamoto's status might depend on Bitcoin's future privacy features. He mentioned ongoing research that could enhance Bitcoin's privacy while addressing quantum vulnerabilities. However, not everyone agrees that such developments would necessarily reveal Nakamoto's identity. An anonymous early Bitcoin miner expressed skepticism, suggesting that even if Nakamoto is alive and possesses the private keys, they might choose not to move the coins, preferring to let the community decide on the matter. Back further elaborated on the challenges of implementing quantum-resistant signatures, noting that most current implementations are either unproven in terms of security or costly in terms of data requirements. He cited Lamport signatures as a reliable design but pointed out their substantial data size. As a solution, Back proposed that Bitcoin should be ready to adopt quantum-resistant signatures but only when absolutely necessary. He suggested a taproot-based implementation that would allow addresses to transition to quantum-resistant signatures as needed. This approach aims to balance security with practicality, ensuring Bitcoin's resilience against future quantum threats.",04-18-2025

Altcoins may be primed for a significant comeback in Q2 2025, driven by regulatory clarity and rising user traction, according to Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum.In its latest Q2 2025 investment outlook, Sygnum noted that while Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate market share—reaching a four-year high in market dominance—altcoins are poised for a breakout as improved regulations and economic incentives shift investor attention.“Drastically improved regulations have laid the groundwork for a strong alt-sector rally,” Sygnum said. “None of the positive developments have been priced in.”Improved U.S. Crypto Policy Boosts Market OutlookSygnum highlighted recent U.S. crypto policy developments, including President Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Stockpile initiative and new stablecoin regulatory frameworks, as key catalysts for altcoin adoption.The bank expects that as user traction grows, successful protocols will begin to outperform BTC and reduce its market dominance.“We expect protocols successful in gaining user traction to outperform and Bitcoin’s dominance to decline,” the report stated.High-Performance Chains and Layer-2 Networks Compete for AdoptionAs competition increases across the blockchain space, Sygnum spotlighted several high-performance protocols like Toncoin (TON), Sui, Aptos, Sonic, and Berachain as contenders in the next wave of crypto innovation.These platforms aim to address scalability and efficiency issues in existing ecosystems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, but face the challenge of translating technology into real-world adoption and sustainable fee income.Berachain: Incentivizes validators to provide liquidity to DeFi apps.Sonic: Rewards developers based on user acquisition and retention.Toncoin: Benefits from Telegram's 1 billion user base to boost network exposure.﻿Sygnum also praised Base, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, for maintaining a lead in metrics like daily transactions, throughput, and total value locked (TVL)—even after the memecoin craze cooled down.Memecoins, AI Tokens Dominate Q1 Investor InterestDespite price pullbacks, memecoins remained one of the top narratives in Q1 2025, trailing only AI tokens, according to a recent CoinGecko report.AI tokens: 35.7% of global investor interestMemecoins: 27.1% of global investor interestInstitutional Interest in Bitcoin Remains StrongWhile retail investors continue speculating on memecoins, institutional players are quietly increasing exposure to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's price may soon experience significant volatility, according to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, as 170,000 BTC recently purchased between three to six months ago has begun to move across wallets.The movement, attributed to short-term holders (STHs), is the largest since late 2021, and historically signals upcoming turbulence in the BTC market.“Around 170,000 BTC are moving from the 3–6 month holder cohort. Large movements from this group often signal that significant volatility is imminent,” CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet wrote.Speculators Stir BTC Market Ahead of Major MoveThe STH cohort — investors who typically hold BTC for under six months — are known for their reactive behavior to short-term narratives, frequently buying on hype and selling on fear.While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade sideways near $84,582, analysts warn that the recent calm may not last long.“Volatility is coming,” Mignolet emphasized, with historical comparisons showing mixed price outcomes following similar events in the past.Short-Term Holders Driving Exchange Selling PressureIn a separate report earlier this week, CryptoQuant’s Crazzyblockk pointed out that STHs are currently the primary source of Bitcoin selling pressure, sending an average of ~930 BTC/day to exchanges.In contrast, long-term holders (LTHs) — those holding BTC for over six months — are moving just ~529 BTC/day, reflecting greater market conviction.“This is not a mass exodus by smart money,” Crazzyblockk noted. “It’s a classic shakeout led by nervous short-term and mid-tier holders.”What’s Next for Bitcoin?Market watchers are closely eyeing macro triggers like upcoming U.S. economic data, CPI prints, and potential Federal Reserve moves for confirmation of BTC’s next major direction.Historically, large-scale movement by short-term holders has preceded both rallies and corrections, making this a key signal for traders and investors to watch in the days ahead, according to Cointelegraph.",04-18-2025

According to PANews, a recent report from blockchain analytics platform DappRadar reveals a significant decline in the frequency of 'Rug Pull' incidents, with only seven occurrences in 2025 compared to 21 in early 2024. Despite the decrease in frequency, the Web3 ecosystem has suffered substantial financial losses, amounting to nearly $6 billion since the beginning of 2025. A staggering 92% of these losses are attributed to the collapse of Mantra's OM token, although its founder denies it being a 'Rug Pull'. In contrast, the total losses from such incidents in the same period of 2024 were $90 million. DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas highlights that while the frequency of these events has decreased, their destructive impact has intensified, with scams becoming increasingly sophisticated and often orchestrated by professional teams. The nature of these incidents is evolving; in the first quarter of 2024, they primarily originated from DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and meme coins, whereas in 2025, they are predominantly occurring in the meme coin sector. Gherghelas also warns of potential indicators of 'Rug Pulls', such as a sudden surge in the number of active wallets, high transaction volumes with low user activity, unverified smart contracts, limited GitHub activity, anonymous developer teams, or projects experiencing abrupt growth.

Binance,"U.S. Crypto Miners Face Challenges Amid Proposed Tariffs on Asian Imports
According to ShibDaily, American cryptocurrency miners are expressing growing concerns over their operational future due to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on Asian imports, which are a significant source of Bitcoin mining equipment. The new tariffs could reach up to 36% on mining hardware manufactured in Southeast Asia, adding pressure on U.S. miners who rely heavily on these imports. Although a standard 10% tariff is currently in place, the proposed trade policy, which would increase import taxes on equipment from countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, has been postponed by a 90-day delay. Originally set to be implemented on April 9, the policy outlines tariff increases ranging from 24% to 36%, potentially escalating operational costs across the mining sector. Fortune reports that Luxor Technology, a marketplace for mining hardware, imports many of its machines from Thailand. Ethan Vera, the company's chief operating officer, stated that the proposed 36% tariff on these imports would severely impact the firm's return on investment. Bitcoin mining in the U.S. is primarily concentrated in Georgia, with significant operations also in Texas and New York. These hubs face high expenses as companies invest heavily in maintaining up-to-date hardware and meeting the substantial electricity demands of their facilities. Vera noted that the machines would not be able to recoup their costs if subjected to an additional 36% tariff, as profit margins are already tight. The rushed efforts to avoid the impending tariff deadline have highlighted the broader challenges and costs associated with altering global supply chains under President Trump's unpredictable trade policies. For the crypto mining industry, the threat of tariffs is particularly disruptive. With few high-performance mining rigs produced domestically, companies are forced to rely on imports to remain competitive in the global Bitcoin market. This situation contrasts sharply with Trump's campaign promises to support American miners and ensure Bitcoin production in the U.S. Instead, fluctuating tariffs and limited domestic options have left mining companies struggling with rising costs and uncertain market conditions, complicating their efforts to expand operations within the country.",04-18-2025

Binance,"Manta Network Co-Founder Warns of Sophisticated Phishing Attack
According to Cointelegraph, Manta Network co-founder Kenny Li recently revealed he was the target of a sophisticated phishing attack on Zoom. The attackers used live recordings of familiar individuals to deceive him into downloading malware. Li recounted the incident in an April 17 post on X, describing how the meeting appeared genuine, with the impersonated person's camera on. However, the absence of sound and a suspicious prompt to download a script raised alarms. Li stated, ""I could see their legit faces. Everything looked very real. But I couldn’t hear them. It said my Zoom needs an update. But it asked me to download a script file. I immediately left."" Li attempted to verify the impersonator's identity through a Telegram call, but they refused and subsequently erased all messages and blocked him. Li suspects the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group orchestrated the attack. He managed to capture screenshots of his conversation with the attacker before the messages were deleted. During the exchange, Li suggested moving the call to Google Meet instead. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Li expressed his belief that the live shots used in the video call were sourced from past recordings of real team members, noting, ""It didn’t seem AI-generated. The quality looked like what a typical webcam quality looks like."" Li confirmed that the real person's accounts had been compromised by the Lazarus Group. He advised the crypto community to be cautious of unexpected download requests, emphasizing, ""The biggest red flag will always be a downloadable.

Binance,"Emerging AI Agent Trends: Practical Frameworks Over Conceptual Narratives
According to PANews, the next wave of AI Agent development is expected to be driven by practical frameworks such as MCP and A2A, rather than conceptual narratives. The challenges faced by web3 AI Agents stem from excessive conceptualization, where grand visions of decentralized platforms and user data sovereignty overshadow practical user experiences. This has led to a reluctance among retail investors to support ambitious yet unfulfilled expectations. In contrast, web2 AI protocols like MCP and A2A have gained traction due to their tangible practicality. MCP functions like a USB-C interface in the AI world, enabling seamless connections between AI models and various data sources and tools. Numerous practical applications of MCP have emerged, such as using Claude to control Blender for 3D modeling, generating complete Figma design files through natural language, and programmers utilizing Cursor for comprehensive coding and Git submissions. Initially, web3 AI Agents were anticipated to innovate within DeFai and GameFai verticals, but many applications remain at the 'showcase' level of natural language processing interfaces, lacking practical utility. By combining MCP and A2A, more robust multi-agent collaboration systems can be developed, allowing specialized agents to handle complex tasks. For instance, analysis agents can read on-chain data and analyze market trends, while prediction and risk management agents collaborate to execute tasks previously handled by single agents. Successful MCP applications provide a model for the emergence of new web3 trading and gaming agents. The hybrid framework standards based on MCP and A2A offer advantages in user-friendliness and application deployment speed for web2 users. The focus now is on integrating web3 value capture and incentive mechanisms with DeFai and GameFai application scenarios. Projects that continue to adhere strictly to web3 conceptualism without embracing web2 practicality risk missing out on the upcoming AI Agent trend. In summary, the forthcoming AI Agent trend is brewing, but it will rely on practicality and application deployment rather than past narrative-driven concept promotion.",04-18-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin's Stability Amid Economic Uncertainty Attributed to ETF Holders and Strategic Purchases
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's price stability in the face of macroeconomic challenges is largely due to the resilience of spot Bitcoin ETF holders and the aggressive purchasing strategy of Michael Saylor's firm. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that these entities have been absorbing Bitcoin from various sources, including market 'tourists' and government confiscations. Balchunas noted in an April 16 post that this buying behavior has contributed to Bitcoin's relative stability despite market volatility. Balchunas emphasized that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, totaling $131.04 million over the past 30 days and increasing by $2.4 billion since the beginning of the year. He described this trend as 'impressive,' suggesting that it plays a crucial role in maintaining Bitcoin's stability. According to Balchunas, Bitcoin ETF investors possess 'stronger hands' than commonly perceived, which could enhance Bitcoin's stability and reduce its volatility and correlation over time.

Binance,"Solana Community Considers New Proposal to Reform Inflation Governance
According to PANews, Galaxy Research has submitted a proposal to the Solana community aimed at reforming the network's inflation governance through a method called Multi-Election Staking Weight Aggregation (MESA). This mechanism seeks to introduce a market-driven process to optimize the SOL emission curve without relying on single-result voting. The proposed approach does not alter Solana's ultimate goal of achieving a 1.5% inflation rate but could significantly shorten the timeline to reach this target based on community voting outcomes. Galaxy predicts that maintaining the current 15% deflation rate would allow the network to reach the final inflation rate by epoch 2,135, and increasing the deflation rate could advance this timeline. In the existing Solana system, inflation follows a fixed, time-related curve with the aim of achieving a 1.5% final inflation rate. However, Galaxy notes that previous votes have shown a consensus challenge in adjusting parameters, despite a general belief that the inflation rate is higher than necessary. The new proposal offers an alternative by allowing validators to choose from multiple predetermined deflation rates, with results determined by the weighted average of these votes. MESA voting will not dynamically adjust inflation based on real-time metrics but will enforce a fixed anti-inflation trajectory once approved, with the deflation rate adjusted according to the collective opinion of validators.",04-18-2025

For June, the likelihood of unchanged rates stands at 38.2%, while the probability of a cumulative 25 basis point cut is 54.1%, and a 50 basis point cut is 7.6%.

Binance,"Arizona's Crypto Reserve Bill Nears Final Approval Amid Legislative Challenges
According to Cointelegraph, Arizona's Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill, known as SB 1373, has successfully passed the House Committee of the Whole and is now poised for a final vote before potentially reaching the governor's desk for official approval. This bill aims to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund, which would be composed of digital assets seized through criminal proceedings and managed by the state's treasurer. The legislation permits the treasurer to invest up to 10% of the fund's total assets in digital currencies each fiscal year. Additionally, the treasurer is authorized to loan the fund's assets to enhance returns, provided that such actions do not increase financial risks.Despite the progress of SB 1373, its future remains uncertain due to potential opposition from Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. Governor Hobbs has recently committed to vetoing all bills until the legislature passes a bill addressing disability funding. Her history of vetoing legislation is notable, with 15 bills rejected this week alone. Alongside SB 1373, Arizona's legislature is also considering the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, or SB 1025, which focuses solely on Bitcoin. This bill proposes allowing the state's treasury and retirement system to invest up to 10% of available funds in Bitcoin. SB 1025 has also passed the House Committee of the Whole and awaits a full floor vote.The movement to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves is gaining momentum across the United States. While Arizona is advancing its own initiatives, other states are also making strides. Utah recently passed Bitcoin legislation but removed the key provision for a Bitcoin reserve in the final reading. Meanwhile, the Texas Senate approved a Bitcoin reserve bill, and a similar proposal has progressed through New Hampshire's House. These developments highlight a growing interest among states to incorporate digital assets into their financial strategies, despite varying levels of legislative support and potential executive challenges.",04-18-2025
Binance,"Market Volatility Persists Amid Trade and Tariff Uncertainty
According to BlockBeats, Greeks.live analyst Adam noted a significant cooling in market activity this week, with fewer announcements from U.S. President Donald Trump contributing to the slowdown.

Medium to long-term RV ranges between 50% and 60%, with IV concentrated around 50%.The analyst anticipates that the trade and tariff conflicts are far from over, suggesting that market uncertainty and volatility will persist for the foreseeable future. The volume of deliveries accounts for less than 10% of total open interest, and the put-call ratio (PCR) has remained high, indicating a stronger market concern for declines over expectations of rises.April and June options holdings are stable at around 25%, suggesting a relatively solid market structure with a high likelihood of sideways movement.

Binance,"Gold's Record Surge Sparks Bitcoin Price Speculation
According to PANews, gold prices reached a historic high of $3,357 per ounce on April 17, prompting speculation about whether Bitcoin will follow suit. Historically, Bitcoin has surged following significant increases in gold prices. In 2017, Bitcoin soared to $19,120 after gold rose by 30% months earlier. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, gold hit a peak of nearly $2,075, and Bitcoin subsequently climbed to $69,000 in 2021. This pattern suggests a dynamic relationship between the two assets during times of economic uncertainty and when investors seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar. Joe Consorti, head of growth at Theya, highlighted the connection between these assets, noting that Bitcoin tends to follow gold's directional movement with a lag of 100 to 150 days. Consorti stated, ""When the printing press starts, gold senses it first, and then Bitcoin follows with a stronger rally."" Based on Consorti's analysis, Bitcoin is expected to reach new all-time highs between the third and fourth quarters of 2025.

Binance,"Wyoming Considers Policy Adjustments for Stablecoin Regulation
According to PANews, the Wyoming Stablecoin Commission is contemplating changes to its policy language to align with potential regulatory guidelines from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During a meeting held on April 17 at the Wyoming State Capitol extension, committee member Joel Revill suggested that the commission could mitigate the risk of the proposed WYST stablecoin being classified as a security under SEC rules. Previously, the SEC issued guidance indicating that certain 'regulated stablecoins' are considered 'non-securities' and are largely exempt from reporting requirements. Following this, discussions ensued among committee members and Executive Director Anthony Apollo. Apollo stated, ""We intend to create our own terminology around some of these issues for clarification, which will serve as a starting point for committee discussions."" He added that while internal discussions regarding the SEC's guidelines have taken place, the matter will be addressed in a memorandum scheduled for May. The Wyoming Stablecoin Commission was established following the state's enactment of a law to issue a state-level stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and redeemable for fiat currency. The commission has been exploring issues related to the WYST stablecoin. Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon initially announced plans to launch the stablecoin in the first quarter of 2025, but the timeline was later adjusted to a potential release in July.",04-18-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Google Search Interest Peaks in March 2025
According to BlockBeats, Bitcoin's search interest on Google reached a score of 34 in March 2025, marking the highest level of the year. This represents a 26% increase compared to January and February, which had scores of 31 and 27, respectively. This surge indicates a reversal in the declining trend observed since November 2024. Similarly, Ethereum's search interest also peaked in March, reaching a score of 19, slightly up from 16 in February. Analysts suggest that the increased interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum may reflect renewed curiosity among retail investors, outperforming the trends seen earlier in 2025. A broader theory for the rise in Bitcoin interest could be linked to the newly announced U.S. tariffs, which may have reignited narratives around Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" and a ""store of value,"" particularly amid heightened geopolitical or macroeconomic tensions. Supporting this theory, the BTC to SPX ratio has risen over 8% since the announcement of tariffs on April 2, known as ""Liberation Day.""",04-17-2025

Binance,"OpenAI's Acquisition Efforts and Financial Outlook in 2025
According to Cointelegraph, OpenAI has been actively pursuing acquisitions to bolster its AI capabilities. The company initially engaged in discussions with Anysphere, the creator of the Cursor AI coding assistant, in both 2024 and 2025. However, these negotiations did not result in a deal, prompting OpenAI to explore other opportunities. Currently, OpenAI is reportedly considering a $3 billion acquisition of WindSurf, which would mark its largest corporate purchase to date. The pursuit of an AI coding assistant company aligns with OpenAI's strategic goals following the release of DeepSeek R1 in January 2025. This AI model has challenged existing beliefs about the necessity of massive computing power for scaling, as it was developed at a fraction of the cost of leading AI models while maintaining comparable performance. The introduction of DeepSeek R1 has had significant implications, unsettling financial markets and prompting questions about the substantial investments made by U.S. AI giants. OpenAI is on track to significantly increase its revenue in 2025, with projections indicating a rise to approximately $12.7 billion, driven by paid subscriptions for its AI models. The company achieved a milestone of over 1 million premium business subscribers by September 2024. Despite these gains, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has indicated that the company may not achieve profitability until 2029, citing the need for revenues of around $125 billion to offset its capital-intensive operations. Altman has noted a dramatic reduction in AI development costs, stating that the cost to utilize a given level of AI decreases by about tenfold every year. Despite these advancements, OpenAI and other large-scale corporate AI developers face challenges from more agile open-source competitors. Dr. Ala Shaabana, co-founder of the OpenTensor Foundation, emphasized that the release of DeepSeek has reinforced the viability of open-source AI as a formidable alternative to centralized systems. Shaabana highlighted that the lower costs associated with open-source AI demonstrate that achieving high-performance benchmarks does not necessarily require billions of dollars in investment.",04-17-2025
Binance,"U.S. Jobless Claims Fall Below Expectations Amid Economic Uncertainty
According to Cointelegraph, the latest data on U.S. initial jobless claims revealed a figure of 215,000, which is below the anticipated 225,000 as of April 17, 2025. This decline suggests a stable labor market, with fewer individuals impacted by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. Initial jobless claims serve as a crucial economic indicator, reflecting the health of the U.S. economy and influencing investor sentiment, particularly concerning risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC).The resilience in the labor market follows recent remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding the effects of tariffs. During a press conference at the Economics Club of Chicago on April 16, Powell highlighted that the announced tariff increases are significantly larger than expected, likely leading to higher inflation and slower economic growth. He also emphasized that the Federal Reserve has no immediate plans to intervene with market bailouts or implement rate cuts, maintaining a cautious stance amid ongoing economic uncertainties. This aligns with his earlier comments from April 4, 2025, where he stated it was ""too soon"" to consider rate reductions.In contrast, the European Central Bank has responded to economic pressures from U.S. trade tariffs by reducing interest rates to 2.25% from 2.50%. This marks the ECB's seventh rate cut within a year, bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level since late 2022. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains at a critical juncture, with the recent U.S. jobless claims data suggesting a bearish outlook in the short term for risk assets. A robust labor market diminishes the likelihood of rate cuts, which typically support speculative investments.Bitcoin prices have been consolidating within a narrow range, struggling to surpass the $86,000 mark. An anonymous crypto trader, Titan of Crypto, described Bitcoin as being at an ""inflection point,"" where market direction or momentum could shift significantly. The trader noted that on the 1-hour chart, Bitcoin is contracting within a triangle pattern and is poised to choose a direction, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50 and attempting to break resistance. Order flow trader Magus observed that Bitcoin is consolidating between $83,700 and $85,200, emphasizing that for bullish momentum to continue, Bitcoin must break above $85,000 soon.

Binance,"Ethena Labs and Securitize Unveil Converge Network Roadmap for 2025
According to Cointelegraph, Ethena Labs, the creator of the USDe synthetic dollar, and financial technology firm Securitize have announced a preliminary roadmap for their forthcoming Converge network. This high-throughput blockchain aims to integrate real-world assets with decentralized finance (DeFi). The announcement outlines plans for a testnet launch in the coming weeks, followed by a mainnet release later in 2025. Converge is set to feature a native block time of 100 milliseconds, with ambitions to reduce this to 50 milliseconds by the fourth quarter of 2025. Additionally, the developers aim to achieve a throughput of at least one gigagas, a measure of billions of gas units processed per second, during the year. The Converge network is being developed to support both permissioned real-world tokenized applications and permissionless DeFi applications, reflecting the ongoing convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. This blending of TradFi and DeFi has sparked varied reactions within the crypto community. Some view the integration as an inevitable evolution, while others express concerns over potential institutional dominance. In a recent interview, Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson emphasized the need for regulatory clarity to facilitate the integration of crypto and traditional finance. She noted that clear regulations could drive down costs and foster innovation. Shibtoshi, founder of the SilentSwap privacy-preserving trading platform, shared insights with Cointelegraph regarding institutional adoption of DeFi. He highlighted that while some institutions are hesitant due to privacy concerns, legal liabilities, and regulatory uncertainties, solutions to these issues are already available. Shibtoshi pointed out that institutions have recognized the advantages of decentralized systems, with reports from as early as 2021 indicating that nearly one-third of institutional crypto investors were utilizing DeFi.

Binance,"Market Sentiment Remains Bearish as Funding Rates Indicate Downtrend
According to BlockBeats, data from Coinglass reveals that the funding rates on major centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX and DEX) continue to indicate a bearish market sentiment. The funding rates for key cryptocurrencies are shown in the accompanying data.Funding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between contract prices and the prices of the underlying assets, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the trading platform collecting these fees. It serves to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts, ensuring that contract prices remain close to the underlying asset prices.A funding rate of 0.01% is considered the baseline. When the funding rate exceeds 0.01%, it suggests a bullish market sentiment. Conversely, when the funding rate falls below 0.005%, it indicates a bearish market sentiment.",04-17-2025

Binance,"USD1 Stablecoin Surges to 90% Circulation on BNB Chain Amid Zero Gas Fee Initiative
The pro-America stablecoin USD1 has reached a major adoption milestone, with nearly 90% of its total circulating supply now deployed on BNB Chain, according to the latest data from Dune Analytics. As of mid-April, over 113 million USD1 tokens have been issued, with approximately 101 million circulating on BNB Chain, highlighting the network’s role as the primary infrastructure for the fast-growing stablecoin.BNB Chain Becomes the Home of USD1The surge in adoption comes shortly after USD1 was added to BNB Chain’s zero-gas-fee stablecoin initiative, allowing users to transact with USD1 without incurring gas fees. This cost-saving measure has significantly enhanced the stablecoin’s attractiveness for everyday users and DeFi protocols alike.BNB Chain’s low transaction fees, high-speed finality, and vast decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem have made it an ideal launchpad for USD1, especially compared to high-fee alternatives like Ethereum.“BNB Chain’s dominance in stablecoin infrastructure makes it the natural choice for scalable and efficient USD1 adoption,” one ecosystem developer noted.Strategic Ecosystem: WLFI and the Role of USD1USD1 plays a central role in the World Liberty Finance (WLFI) ecosystem, a DeFi protocol focused on on-chain payments, remittances, and commerce with a pro-American policy lens. Backed 1:1 and fully redeemable, USD1 is emerging as both a practical digital dollar and a tool of political branding and financial inclusion.Recent reports suggest WLFI has ties to the Trump family, further fueling speculation that USD1 may serve as a flagship asset in the evolving “crypto-conservative” movement.Institutional Backing: DWF Labs Invests $25M in WLFIInstitutional support for WLFI and USD1 is growing. DWF Labs recently announced a $25 million investment in WLFI tokens and is expanding its U.S. footprint with a new office in New York City.The firm’s move signals growing institutional interest in stablecoin infrastructure and includes:Liquidity support for USD1 across DeFi markets.Deeper partnerships with U.S. banks and fintech firms.Strategic recruitment in compliance, business development, and trading.Enhanced policy outreach and academic collaboration.What This Means for the Stablecoin MarketBNB Chain’s zero gas fee campaign—along with USD1’s focus on accessibility, efficiency, and national branding—could set a new precedent for stablecoin growth strategies. While traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC maintain dominance on Ethereum and multi-chain ecosystems, USD1 is carving out a niche on BNB Chain as the default stablecoin for cost-conscious and politically aligned users.As the competition between Layer-1 blockchains intensifies, subsidized transaction costs and curated stablecoin adoption strategies are becoming key battlegrounds for liquidity and user acquisition, according to Altcoin Buzz.",04-17-2025

The memorandum references several high-profile bankruptcy cases from 2022, noting that while not all involved criminal charges, many resulted in investor losses due to fraud and theft of digital assets. Additionally, the DOJ pointed out that the value of these digital assets has significantly increased in the years following these incidents.

Top Interest of the Week Mantra ($OM) is a blockchain ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technology. In February, the project team increased the total supply of OM from 888,888,888 to 1,777,777,777, minting the new OM coins directly on the MANTRA Chain. This adjustment in tokenomics raised significant concerns in the market, and a 90% drop occurred over the weekend following substantial transfers from wallets associated with the Mantra team and its investors to exchanges.Orca ($ORCA) stands out as one of the pioneering general-purpose automated market makers (AMMs) on the Solana network. It allows users to swap assets, provide liquidity, and earn yields through a user-friendly interface. Recently, Orca's trading volume has exceeded that of Raydium ($RAY), making it the most active DeFi platform within the Solana ecosystem.StakeStone, a DeFi platform that provides decentralized liquidity infrastructure, has initiated a new partnership with Sei Network ($SEI), an advanced Layer 1 blockchain aimed at enhancing DeFi applications and trading.

Additionally, the crypto project World Liberty Financial (WIFI), which the Trump family backed, has acquired more SEI tokens for its portfolio, prompting interest from investors.Overall MarketSource: TradingViewThe above chart is the BTC price in the daily candle chart at a log scale.In our analysis last week, we maintained a neutral short-term outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) while adopting a bearish perspective for the next 6 to 12 months. This long-term bearish view was strengthened by BTC's failure to break through the $91,000 resistance level in March, along with the negative effects of President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on risk assets. We will consider a more optimistic outlook only when the Federal Reserve indicates the end of its quantitative tightening (QT) phase and starts to ease monetary policy. However, recent events—especially the ongoing tariff headlines and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious approach to rate cuts—have reinforced our bearish stance, aligning with our assessment from last week.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released last Thursday showed a slowdown in the inflation rate in the U.S., indicating a possible reduction in price pressures. However, this information is based on previous economic conditions and does not reflect the inflationary threats stemming from current U.S. trade policies. The tariffs enacted by the Trump administration are expected to intensify inflationary pressures shortly by raising the costs of imported goods. Additionally, the rising trade conflicts between the U.S. and its trading partners have created considerable uncertainty in global markets, leading investors to shift from riskier assets to safe-haven assets. This shift is exemplified by gold reaching a historic peak of $3,357 on Wednesday, highlighting the trend towards safety amid rising geopolitical and economic challenges.On Wednesday, Fed Chair Powell gave a speech highlighting the Federal Reserve's desire for clearer economic indicators before making any changes to monetary policy. This hawkish stance, which suggests a hesitance to lower interest rates too soon, heightened market anxieties, resulting in a significant drop in U.S. stock prices after his remarks. In contrast to the overall risk-averse mood, Bitcoin (BTC) showed remarkable strength, maintaining solid support around the $83,300 mark. This unexpected stability in BTC's value is likely linked to the weakening U.S. dollar, as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell by 4% following President Trump’s detailed tariff announcements. A declining dollar typically enhances BTC's attractiveness as an alternative store of value, offering a temporary counterbalance to the prevailing bearish trends.While Bitcoin (BTC) has shown resilience in the short term, our analysis suggests that this support is fragile and contingent on forthcoming bullish catalysts to sustain any upward momentum. The recent price action in BTC mirrors patterns observed in February, characterized by multiple long upside wicks on daily candles and price consolidation within a narrow range. This technical formation, coupled with a descending channel, suggests that resistance levels are progressively lowering, signalling potential weakness. Unless significant bullish developments emerge, such as a resolution to trade tensions or a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve, we anticipate that BTC will retest the $82,500 support band in the near future. Should BTC break above the $86,000 resistance, it could regain upward momentum and aim for the $91,000 resistance level. However, in the absence of such a breakout, we remain cautious and expect continued downward pressure on BTC's price in the upcoming days.Macro at a glance Last Thursday (25-04-10)In March, the US headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) experienced a 0.1% decline, contrary to the anticipated 0.1% rise, leading to a decrease in annualized inflation from 2.8% in February to 2.4% in March.

Binance,"Nillion’s Blind Compute: The Future of Privacy Computing in 2025
The explosion of the AI sector has rapidly reshaped the perception of data value, bringing with it growing concerns about data privacy. The urgent challenge now lies in unlocking data utility while preserving user privacy. To tackle this, developers are exploring a range of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), such as MPC, TEE, and FHE. However, each has its limitations: TEE relies heavily on centralised hardware vendors, MPC has execution inefficiencies, and FHE is still maturing in terms of performance.Against this backdrop, Nillion emerged. Nillion team says the original vision behind Nillion was to offer developers a privacy-preserving alternative for building applications that utilize user-contributed data. This vision has become even more essential in the age of artificial intelligence, enabling developers to harness AI’s power without compromising user privacy.Nillion further introduced the concept of Blind Compute, which empowers users to maintain full control over their data, unlocking new opportunities within their ecosystem. Unlike traditional systems where large corporations profit from user data without consent, Nillion shifts the power back to individuals. Users have the freedom to decide what data to share, how it’s used, and how you benefit from it.Following a series of milestone developments, including the launch of its Alpha Mainnet and a community airdrop, Nillion is accelerating its efforts to build a privacy-preserving computational network. On this key occasion, Binance News conducted an in-depth interview with Nillion’s team to unpack the project’s architectural design, product roadmap, and ecosystem strategy—revealing the team’s latest perspectives on the future of privacy computing.What Is Blind Compute?According to official documentation, Nillion is a decentralized data storage and computation network that allows applications to unlock data value while safeguarding user privacy.In traditional systems, performing computations on sensitive data requires decrypting it first, and then re-encrypting the result—an inherently insecure process that exposes data to potential leaks. Nillion takes a fundamentally different approach by enabling computation on encrypted data, a capability it calls Blind Compute.﻿﻿To enable Blind Compute, Nillion integrated multiple PETs. According to the team, the design of Blind Compute is a core component of their mission to build privacy-first computing. During the early development phase, they evaluated a wide range of PET solutions to identify the most suitable approach. The team also mentioned testing technologies such as NIL Message Compute (NMC), but ultimately discontinued them due to insufficient performance efficiency.The Nillion team ultimately selected Multi-Party Computation (MPC) as the foundational technology for Blind Compute. They explained that MPC—especially linear secret sharing schemes—stood out as both the most technically straightforward and secure option. MPC’s low overhead for simple statistical computations makes it ideal for Nillion’s core use cases. The team also believes that MPC offers strong scalability potential for more complex workflows, particularly as macrotrends like improved network communication speeds continue to evolve. Taken together, the security, efficiency, and extensibility of MPC made it the most suitable starting point for implementing Blind Compute.As of now, Nillion has integrated several PETs, including MPC, FHE, TEE, and ZKPs. However, the team has emphasized that integration is ongoing. Future decisions will depend on feasibility, maturity, performance, and above all, alignment with Nillion’s high security standards. Only PETs that balance performance and robust security will be considered.Regarding whether integrating multiple PETs would introduce system-level complexity, the Nillion team stated that in any distributed infrastructure, managing multiple PETs in parallel requires careful attention to avoid issues like instabilities or race conditions.To address this, the team keeps different parts of the stack independent, with nodes running in separate containers and allocated sufficient resources to scale effectively. Additionally, Nillion also minimizes synchronous communication, which helps reduce complexity and enhances system stability.Inside the Nillion Network: A Dual-layer System Built on nilChain and PetnetThe Nillion Network architecture consists of two key components: nilChain, the coordination layer, and Petnet, the orchestration layer. The nilChain is responsible not for computation, but for managing system-level functions including incentive mechanisms, governance procedures, cryptoeconomic security, and inter-cluster coordination.Petnet, by contrast, is where computation takes place. It is a network of nodes equipped with various PET technologies that allow encrypted data to be securely stored and computed. Developers can assign nodes to clusters based on performance, security, geographic distribution, or specific PET requirements—creating flexible, purpose-built networks.The Nillion team explains that the Nillion network distributes responsibilities between a traditional blockchain and an orchestration layer that integrates various PET resources, making them accessible to both developers and users. And the design emphasizes modularity and component independence, ensuring interoperability while allowing developers to select the precise capabilities they need for their target use cases.Nillion’s documentation emphasizes that Petnet represents the future of privacy-enhancing computation. This view is grounded in the inherent complexity and diversity of PETs. As the team explains:“PETs address multiple problems; some even offer different solutions to the same problem, but with tradeoffs in areas such as performance, security, and cost. Therefore, rather than betting on a single technology, Nillion’s Orchestration Layer seamlessly integrates multiple PETs like MPC, FHE, TEE, and ZKPs, optimizing security, cost, performance, and functionality. It operates through Blind Modules (powering the Blind Computer) and SDKs (making them accessible to developers).”﻿﻿The Nillion team stated that Nillion is currently progressing through Levels 2, 3, and 4 of the Petnet evolution roadmap.At Level 2, the SecretLLM SDK integrates NilDB and NilAI.At Level 3, NilDB supports both linear secret sharing and homomorphic encryption, while NilAI is advancing combining TEEs and a specialized MPC protocol for AI model evaluation.At Level 4, NilDB nodes can be deployed in different Clusters, each one featuring unique configurations based on factors such as the number of nodes, their locations, hardware specifications, and security threshold parameters for the linear secret sharing schemes.However, the team acknowledges that achieving full Level 4 functionality presents technical challenges, in particular, NilAI must also support multi-cluster configurations, and developers will need appropriate tooling to identify and select the clusters best suited to their application needs.Regarding cluster management, the Nillion team explains that Nillion allows developers to assemble their own clusters from available node providers, giving them the flexibility to select nodes based on performance and security needs. Developers also have the option to run their own nodes within the cluster for added security. All in all, Nillion enables third parties to contribute nodes, allowing them to be part of any developer-defined cluster.When asked about how Nillion maintains system integrity without relying on a global consensus mechanism, the Nillion team explains: MPC ensures that even a small number of well-behaved nodes can maintain the security of data and computations. By utilizing Shamir’s secret sharing, the system reduces the number of nodes required to uphold the integrity of encrypted data. Users can either run their own nodes or rely on a trusted party to run at least one, making collusion among other nodes ineffective and ensuring overall system stability.Governance & Incentives: Shifting From Tasks to ValueIn 2025, Nillion achieved significant milestones on both the technical and ecosystem fronts. One of the notable developments was the official release of its tokenomics for the NIL token, with 20% allocated to incentivize the community. In line with this, Nillion’s Chief Marketing Officer Charlie Rogers released a statement detailing the logic and evaluation methods behind the drop.To better understand the philosophy and direction behind this airdrop, we asked the Nillion team for more details.They explained that the Nillion airdrop was designed to reward those who have demonstrated long-term value to the ecosystem. Rather than using traditional behavior-driven models (like task completion or check-ins), the airdrop focused on value-based recognition. This included not only technical contributions such as development and verification, but also non-technical forms of support like writing, art, and design that help shape the community culture.As the team emphasized, “We want to recognize those who truly believe in Nillion’s vision and have walked alongside us throughout the journey — not those who simply show up for rewards.”Ecosystem Strategy:AI, DeSci, and DePIN Use Cases of NillionAlongside its community efforts, Nillion has been building out its ecosystem. Many projects are now building on Nillion, including AI training platforms, DePIN infrastructure, and decentralized identity systems.﻿﻿Looking ahead, Nillion team believes that AI agentic implementations will see the strongest adoption, closely followed by use cases in healthcare/DeSci and DePIN. These sectors require secure storage and computation of sensitive data, capabilities that Nillion uniquely enables.To support this growth, Nillion will prioritize:AI: Enabling private, personalized agents that can access and process user data without compromising privacy.Healthcare/DeSci: Powering composable private data in health analytics, allowing individuals to securely share and compute on health data without exposing it.DePIN: Empowering decentralized physical infrastructure networks with secure storage and computation of sensitive real-world data. Nillion enables these systems to analyze data across multiple users without compromising privacy, unlocking new insights and operational efficiencies across logistics, IoT, mobility, and beyond.Nillion also supports developers through its Nucleus program(https://nucleus.nillion.com), a flexible, ongoing initiative tailored to builders at any stage.Key areas of support include:Technical Integration: Hands-on guidance from Nillion’s solutions team to help with SDK usage and integration into Nillion’s technology.Go-to-Market Strategy: Strategic support in refining product marketing positioning, identifying target users, and assistance for launch.Marketing & Visibility: Co-marketing campaigns, product features, and ecosystem exposure to grow your presence and reach.Financial Incentives: Access to network credits and token grants for projects aligned with core focus areas like AI, healthcare, and DePIN.Community & Partnerships: Connect with fellow builders and potential collaborators within Nillion’s growing ecosystem.﻿Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Nillion’s Network and CommunityAs the privacy computing sector evolves rapidly, new players are steadily joining the space, contributing to the accelerated expansion of the ecosystem. In response, the Nillion team stated, ""Privacy is not a privilege; it’s a fundamental human right, and it's inspiring to see more projects joining this movement."" They emphasized, ""At Nillion, we believe privacy isn’t about competition, it’s about collaboration, and we’re proud to see others aligning with the vision we have championed.""Amid growing activity in the privacy space, the Nillion team has articulated a clear differentiation strategy: focusing on the usability of PET infrastructure and tooling, orchestrating multiple PET solutions together, and iterating quickly on solutions that address the most pressing technologies today, such as AI and DeSci.At the same time, the team emphasizes that Nillion’s true moat lies not just in technology, but in the strength of its community. “Our Blind Warriors can be found across every corner of crypto Twitter, supporting and amplifying our mission.”Looking ahead, the Nillion team revealed that it will continue advancing network expansion and technical development — including connecting to partner chains and expanding Blind Compute across the entire crypto ecosystem. At the same time, Nillion will keep working to enhance orchestration between the Blind Modules and continue advancing decentralization efforts.Read MoreBinance Introduces Nillion (NIL) on Launchpool: Earn NIL by Staking BNB, FDUSD, and USDCNillion Integrates With NEAR To Enhance Data Privacy And AI ManagementDisclaimerThis article includes third-party opinions and does not constitute financial advice.

Binance,"Stablecoins Gain Traction Amid U.S. Banking Limitations
According to Cointelegraph, stablecoins have surged in popularity due to constraints within the U.S. financial system, particularly limited banking hours and the absence of non-USD trading pairs. Jerald David, president of Arca Labs, highlighted these issues during a panel at the TokenizeThis 2025 event on April 16. The discussion focused on yieldcoins, a type of cryptocurrency that can generate returns through holding, staking, or lending, similar to stablecoins. David emphasized that traditional nine-to-five banking hours are inadequate for the needs of a 24-hour industry. He noted that upcoming payment systems are expected to integrate yield-bearing instruments with stabletokens, addressing these limitations. The panel also addressed Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, which are crucial for tax compliance. A representative from Figure Markets stated that all yield-bearing stablecoin holders would need to undergo KYC checks.

According to Cointelegraph, Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has expressed concerns over U.S. stablecoin policies, suggesting they pose a greater threat to European financial stability than U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Speaking at an event in Milan, Giorgetti highlighted the potential of dollar-backed stablecoins to undermine the euro's dominance in cross-border payments. He emphasized that while trade tariffs often capture media attention, the implications of U.S. stablecoin policies are ""even more dangerous"" for Europe. Giorgetti pointed out that U.S. stablecoins offer a widely accepted method for cross-border payments without requiring a U.S. bank account, making them increasingly appealing to Europeans. He cautioned against underestimating their growing popularity and urged European Union lawmakers to take decisive action to bolster the euro's position as an international currency. Giorgetti also noted the importance of the digital euro, currently under development by the European Central Bank (ECB), as a means to reduce reliance on foreign solutions. In the United States, stablecoin regulation remains fragmented, with multiple agencies applying existing laws rather than a unified framework. However, efforts are underway to address this, with several pieces of legislation advancing. On April 2, the U.S. House Financial Services Committee passed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, which now awaits a full vote in the House. Introduced by Committee Chair French Hill and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, the bill mandates that stablecoin issuers disclose information about their businesses, including token backing. Additionally, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act proposes rules requiring issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves, comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, protect consumers, and enhance the dollar's global dominance. The GENIUS Act still needs approval from both chambers of Congress and a presidential signature to become law. ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone has also called on European lawmakers to counter the influence of dollar-backed stablecoins in Europe.

In April 2022, the OCC issued a consent order highlighting deficiencies in Anchorage’s compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering standards. The order mandated the formation of a dedicated oversight committee to address these issues under OCC supervision. Founded in 2017 by Diogo Mónica and Nathan McCauley, Anchorage Digital has established itself as a significant player in institutional crypto custody. The firm serves as the custodian for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen inflows exceeding $35.5 billion since their launch in January. Additionally, Anchorage manages custody and collateral services for Cantor Fitzgerald’s Bitcoin assets. The investigation into Anchorage Digital is significant for both the crypto and traditional financial sectors, occurring amid increased regulatory scrutiny of digital asset firms. As a federally chartered institution with connections to major Wall Street entities, Anchorage’s operations are expected to remain closely monitored as the investigation unfolds.",04-16-2025
Binance,"SWIFT May Integrate Ripple's XRP Ledger, Signaling Blockchain Finance Milestone
According to ShibDaily, the global interbank network SWIFT is reportedly considering the integration of Ripple's XRP Ledger into its systems, a move that could signify a major advancement in the fusion of blockchain technology with traditional financial systems. Crypto analyst John Squire has highlighted increasing speculation within the digital asset community about a potential announcement from SWIFT. Squire noted that several influential figures have suggested that SWIFT might soon officially announce the incorporation of Ripple's XRP into its international payment framework. The dates April 16 and April 21 are being viewed as potentially pivotal in XRP's history, not due to hype, but because of the context, data, and a narrative that has been developing over the years. Squire pointed out that SWIFT recently released a report discussing the integration of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), with Ripple being mentioned. He questioned whether the proximity of these dates is merely coincidental or part of a strategic plan to transition from one phase to another. Ripple has been expanding its presence in traditional finance, highlighted by its $1.25 billion acquisition of the global prime brokerage platform Hidden Road and the introduction of its stablecoin, RLUSD. These developments have fueled speculation about a potential partnership with SWIFT, as Ripple's role in connecting blockchain technology with established financial systems continues to grow. This speculation follows a significant legal development for Ripple. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indicated its intention to dismiss the remaining claims in its long-standing lawsuit against Ripple. This case, which began in 2020, focused on whether the sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering. The potential resolution of this legal battle marks a crucial turning point for Ripple, which had been overshadowed by the lawsuit. With the SEC stepping back, Ripple is regaining momentum, and the timing of this legal breakthrough alongside renewed partnership rumors is generating optimism among industry observers. There is hope that Ripple may finally achieve the regulatory clarity needed to secure major collaborations, possibly even with established entities like SWIFT.",04-16-2025
Binance,"U.S. Administration Explores Bitcoin Reserve Growth Strategies
According to ShibDaily, the U.S. administration is investigating innovative methods to expand its Bitcoin reserve, potentially utilizing tariff revenues from the Trump era to finance new acquisitions. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, confirmed in an April 14 interview with crypto investor Anthony Pompliano that the administration is actively considering various strategies to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Hines stated, ""We’re looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, whether it be from something else. Everything’s on the table."" One of the primary proposals under consideration is Senator Cynthia Lummis’ 2025 Bitcoin Reserve Act, which suggests revaluing U.S. Treasury gold certificates from their long-standing $43 per ounce to the current market rate of $3,223.61. Hines highlighted that such a revaluation could unlock substantial funds for acquiring Bitcoin to build national reserves without the need to issue new debt. He further explained that revaluing the gold certificates could create a significant paper surplus, enabling the government to allocate funds toward Bitcoin purchases without liquidating any physical gold. The aim is to establish a long-term national reserve, not to engage in trading or asset sales. Hines emphasized, ""We obviously have made it very clear that we want to acquire as much as we can get. We have to acquire Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways that don’t cost a taxpayer a dime."" Additionally, Hines disclosed that the White House is preparing a digital asset strategy set to be released this summer. The plan will focus on fostering crypto innovation, regulating emerging sectors such as staking and tokenization, and enhancing the global use of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. As the U.S. explores innovative approaches to building a national Bitcoin reserve, the government’s efforts to integrate Bitcoin and digital assets into its financial framework reflect a growing recognition of the potential of blockchain technology. The forthcoming digital asset strategy and ongoing legislative proposals emphasize a key moment for the country as it seeks to balance regulation with innovation. With further developments expected, the push toward a national Bitcoin reserve could have lasting implications for both traditional and digital financial systems.",04-16-2025
Binance,"Argentina's Regulatory Sandbox Paves Way for Asset Tokenization
According to ShibDaily, Argentina has initiated a yearlong regulatory sandbox aimed at piloting asset tokenization, including stocks, positioning itself as a leader in crypto innovation within the region. The national securities regulator, CNV, has introduced a tokenization framework that encompasses a wide array of financial instruments. These include digital representations of publicly offered assets such as shares, negotiable bonds, closed-end mutual fund shares, debt securities, and participation certificates from financial trusts. To facilitate the rollout, Argentina's securities regulator will employ a one-year sandbox structure, enabling real-world testing of tokenized asset offerings. During this period, the CNV plans to conduct a public consultation to identify and address potential risks, operational challenges, and regulatory gaps before establishing long-term rules. Under the new framework, registered virtual asset service providers (VASPs) will manage the market launch of tokenized securities, operating under a general digitization permit rather than seeking individual approvals. This streamlined process eliminates the need for special authorization, simplifying digital issuances within the sandbox environment. Roberto Silva, President of the CNV, expressed pride in presenting this groundbreaking regulation, considering it a milestone in both the administration at the CNV and the history of the Argentine capital market. Silva emphasized that the Tokenization regime places Argentina at the forefront of developed countries and as a regional beacon. He concluded by expressing optimism that feedback from the public consultation will contribute to shaping a comprehensive and effective regulatory framework. The framework simplifies the process by removing the need for additional public offering approvals for each tokenized asset, provided initial authorization has been granted. Investors holding digital representations will retain full ownership rights and may convert them back into traditional formats at any time. Once the sandbox period concludes, no new tokenized issuances will be permitted under this program, although existing ones will remain valid. If a tokenized security is not digitized within two years of its approval, it will no longer qualify under the regime. The CNV views this initiative as a landmark step toward modernizing the country's capital markets and enhancing its commitment to digital innovation.

Binance,"Bitcoin News Today: 10x Research Analysts Warn of Sideways Trading Despite Long-Term Bullish Hopes
Despite bullish predictions for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs by June, analysts from 10x Research caution that short-term indicators signal a potential market top and an extended period of sideways movement.Bitcoin Price May Be Entering a Consolidation PhaseAccording to 10x Research Head of Research Markus Thielen, Bitcoin’s recent momentum suggests the cryptocurrency is no longer a “parabolic long-only bet” but is instead entering a more mature phase of market behavior. In an April 14 market update, Thielen noted that on-chain and technical indicators reflect bearish or neutral sentiment, rather than early bull market characteristics.Stochastic Oscillator patterns show signals consistent with a market top or late-cycle phase.Bitcoin is trading around $83,810, up 32.8% year-on-year, but shows signs of slowing momentum.“Bitcoin’s rally over the past year hasn’t been driven by ‘crypto-bro’ speculation,” Thielen wrote. “It’s largely due to long-term holders adopting a buy-and-hold diversification strategy.”Bitcoin to Trade in $73K–$94K Range?Thielen expects Bitcoin to consolidate between $73,000 and $94,000, echoing price behavior from 2024, when BTC hovered in a broad range after hitting highs in March. That pattern was interrupted only by major geopolitical and macroeconomic events, such as Donald Trump’s U.S. election win in November 2024.“Short-term signals are diverging from long-term bullish outlooks,” said Thielen, emphasizing a more nuanced, finance-driven approach is now needed for navigating the market.June Could Still Deliver a New All-Time HighWhile 10x Research projects a sideways range, other experts maintain a more optimistic tone:Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, forecasts a 50%+ chance of breaking all-time highs before the end of June.Timothy Peterson and Jamie Coutts have echoed similar views, citing underestimated momentum in the market.BTC's current all-time high of $109,000, reached in January 2025, remains a key psychological and technical resistance level, according to Cointelegraph.",04-16-2025

This marks yet another regulatory victory for Web3 companies under the crypto-friendlier climate of the Trump administration.SEC Closes Case Without ActionCyberKongz revealed via X (formerly Twitter) that the SEC had concluded its inquiry, which had spanned more than two years and included the issuance of a Wells notice last December—a formal letter indicating the possibility of legal action.“After years of litigation, unjust allegations, crippling legal fees, and the biggest hurdle we could possibly encounter—we are free,” CyberKongz stated in a celebratory post.An SEC spokesperson declined to comment, a consistent stance the agency has taken amid a string of recent dropped investigations, including high-profile cases involving Yuga Labs (creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club) and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace.Why Was CyberKongz Under Investigation?The SEC’s scrutiny reportedly centered around:The BANANA token, used within CyberKongz’s ecosystemA blockchain gaming componentThe 2021 migration of its Genesis Kongz NFT contractRegulators allegedly interpreted these elements as potential unregistered securities offerings, raising broader implications for Web3 gaming projects that integrate tokens.CyberKongz criticized the SEC’s token interpretation, calling it “very concerning rhetoric” that could pose risks to the entire Web3 gaming industry.

Binance,"White House Advisor Proposes Budget-Neutral Bitcoin Purchase Strategy
According to PANews, White House advisor Bo Hines recently discussed a 'budget-neutral purchase of BTC' strategy. OKG Research has analyzed five potential pathways for this initiative, including tariff revenue redistribution, gold revaluation, asset tokenization, unused budget recovery, and pension-guided allocation. The estimated potential release scale ranges from $764 billion to over $874 billion. With market multipliers of 2x to 5x, this could potentially drive Bitcoin's market capitalization to increase by $1.5 trillion to $4.4 trillion. Based on actual active circulation estimates, the theoretical price anchor for Bitcoin could be reset to between $207,000 and $398,000 per coin. OKG Research suggests that budget neutrality is not merely a fiscal technique but a precursor to sovereign structures re-anchoring the value of digital assets. The expectation itself already possesses the ability to re-evaluate pricing.",04-16-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin's Death Cross: Historical Patterns and Market Implications
According to BlockBeats, Bitcoin experienced a 'death cross' on April 6, where the 50-day moving average fell below the 200-day moving average on the daily chart. Historically, this technical pattern is often associated with trend reversals and prolonged bearish trading periods, sometimes indicating significant market downturns. Since its inception, Bitcoin has undergone ten such 'death crosses,' with the eleventh currently unfolding. Analyzing the dates and durations of these events reveals a crucial insight: while every bear market includes a 'death cross,' not every 'death cross' leads to a bear market. This distinction is vital for understanding the current market landscape. Notably, the 'death crosses' during the bear markets of 2014-2015, 2018, and 2022 were prolonged and challenging, lasting between 9 to 13 months from the crossover date to the cycle's bottom, with declines ranging from 55% to 68%. The other seven occurrences were far less severe, lasting between 1.5 to 3.5 months, with Bitcoin's price dropping from 27% to no decline at all. In many instances, these signals marked local bottoms, followed by subsequent rebounds. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted that, on average, Bitcoin's price is only slightly lower (-3.2%) one month after a death cross, and typically rises three months later. Therefore, he suggests that a 'death cross' often presents a good buying opportunity.",04-16-2025

Binance,"VanEck Proposes Innovative BitBonds to Address U.S. Debt Refinancing
According to PANews, VanEck's Head of Digital Asset Research, Matthew Sigel, has introduced a novel debt instrument called 'BitBonds,' which combines U.S. Treasury exposure with Bitcoin. This strategy aims to manage the U.S. government's impending $14 trillion refinancing needs. The concept was unveiled at the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Summit, addressing sovereign funding requirements and investors' demand for inflation protection.BitBonds are designed as 10-year securities, comprising 90% traditional U.S. Treasury exposure and 10% Bitcoin, funded by bond sale proceeds. Upon maturity, investors will receive the full value of the U.S. Treasury portion, equating to $90 for every $100 bond, plus the value of the Bitcoin allocation. Additionally, investors will benefit from all Bitcoin gains until the yield reaches 4.5%. Any gains beyond this threshold will be shared equally between the government and bondholders. Sigel noted that for investors confident in Bitcoin, BitBonds offer a 'convex bet,' providing asymmetric upside potential while maintaining a layer of risk-free return. However, the structure implies that investors bear the full downside risk of Bitcoin exposure.Previously, the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) suggested issuing Bitcoin bonds to aid the U.S. in repaying national debt.",04-16-2025

According to Cointelegraph, Strive Asset Management CEO Matt Cole is urging fintech firm Intuit to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, following his successful campaign with game retailer GameStop. In an open letter dated April 14, Cole addressed Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, praising the company's growth while advocating for Bitcoin as a strategic asset to ensure long-term success and mitigate risks associated with artificial intelligence.Intuit, known for its tax preparation app TurboTax and small business accounting software Quickbooks, recently laid off 10% of its workforce to focus on AI initiatives. Cole expressed concerns that TurboTax could be vulnerable to automation, suggesting that Bitcoin could serve as a valuable hedge. He emphasized that a Bitcoin reserve would provide Intuit with strategic capital to navigate the challenges posed by the AI revolution, allowing the company to maintain a strong position amid technological disruptions.Previously, Cole sent a similar letter to GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, advising the retailer to invest its $4.6 billion cash reserve in Bitcoin. Cohen acknowledged the advice in an April 1 regulatory filing, revealing that GameStop had completed a convertible debt offering, raising $1.5 billion, with plans to allocate some of the funds for Bitcoin purchases.In addition to advocating for Bitcoin adoption, Cole urged Intuit to revise the acceptable use policy for its marketing platform Mailchimp. He criticized the platform's suspension of crypto-related accounts, arguing that such policies could negatively impact shareholder value. Mailchimp's current policy restricts accounts involved in the sale, exchange, or marketing of cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and digital assets related to initial coin offerings.Cole suggested that Mailchimp's policies were likely established during a period of legal uncertainty surrounding crypto businesses.

Binance,"Democrats Propose Clean Cloud Act to Transition U.S. Bitcoin Mining and AI Centers to Green Energy
According to BlockBeats, the U.S. Senate has introduced the Clean Cloud Act of 2025, aiming to phase out fossil fuels in cryptocurrency mining and AI data centers by 2035, with penalties for non-compliance. Proposed by Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman, the legislation seeks to impose strict carbon emission limits on these industries, setting a clear timeline to achieve net-zero emissions by 2035. Facilities continuing to use non-renewable energy will face fines.The core mechanism of the bill involves regional emission caps that decrease annually. The Clean Cloud Act will amend the existing Clean Air Act, requiring data centers with energy capacities exceeding 100 kilowatts to adhere to region-specific emission limits. These limits will be based on the U.S. Department of Energy's National Transmission Needs Study, with varying requirements depending on regional energy structures and grid conditions.Emission caps must be established by the end of 2025 and reduced by 11% annually until zero emissions are reached by 2035. Companies exceeding these limits will incur inflation-adjusted fines, and the bill prohibits passing these costs onto customers, ensuring companies bear the environmental responsibility.The legislation mandates annual detailed reports from facilities, including total energy consumption and the proportion of renewable versus fossil fuel energy sources. Notably, the responsibility for fines falls on the ""tenant of the facility,"" not the owner, meaning even those renting servers for mining or AI operations must report data and potentially face fines, broadening the scope of accountability.If passed, the bill could drive cloud service providers and data centers to adopt green energy, appealing to environmentally conscious clients. However, it may pose challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises lacking resources for energy transition and compliance costs.The cryptocurrency mining industry is already trending towards green energy. By the end of 2024, over 50% of the global Bitcoin mining network's energy came from renewable sources like hydro, wind, and solar power. Regions with abundant and affordable green energy, such as Iceland and Quebec, have become popular among miners.Should the Clean Cloud Act pass, mining companies and AI centres must swiftly transition to renewable energy or risk market exclusion. However, under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has previously denied the link between global warming and carbon emissions, the bill may face Republican opposition in Congress, potentially hindering its passage.",04-16-2025

This demand is expected to be sufficient to absorb all new short-term Treasury bonds anticipated to be issued during U.S. President Donald Trump's second term. The analysts estimate that the stablecoin industry will need to purchase $1.6 trillion in short-term Treasury bonds over the next four years, averaging $400 billion annually. This indicates that the industry could become the largest source of purchasing flow for all U.S. Treasury bonds.

Binance,"Crypto Podcasts Play Crucial Role in Mainstream Adoption
According to Cointelegraph, crypto podcasts have emerged as a significant source of information for newcomers, aiding in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. As the popularity of these podcasts grows, it is essential for podcasters to remember that new listeners are constantly tuning in. While seasoned listeners may understand terms like 'FOMO' and 'WAGMI,' newcomers might find the jargon overwhelming and may struggle to grasp the basics of cryptocurrency. Podcasters are increasingly important in the adoption of crypto, as they must engage regular listeners while also ensuring that new listeners can follow along. Successful crypto podcasts manage to balance content for both experienced enthusiasts and novices, maintaining dedicated followings and high view counts regardless of market conditions. Some industry professionals worry that simplifying content might alienate experts, but even seasoned listeners appreciate straightforward content that helps them stay informed without sifting through excessive information. One of the biggest challenges facing the crypto industry is accessibility. The complexity of technology, the vast array of coins, and the intricacies of Web3-powered applications can be daunting for many. Podcasters often discuss advanced topics like quantum-resistant blockchains and Ethereum's updates, which can be confusing for newcomers. However, podcasters can play a pivotal role in making blockchain solutions more accessible by reducing the high knowledge entry barriers. To achieve this balance, podcasters should imagine they are speaking to both a friend who knows nothing about crypto and someone who is already knowledgeable. Content should cater to both audiences, and when jargon is necessary, providing explanations can help avoid alienating new listeners. Simplifying terms like 'WAGMI' and 'NGMI' can encourage more people to engage with crypto exchanges. Successful podcasts often include timestamps in their episodes, allowing listeners to navigate to sections that interest them most. This approach enhances engagement and loyalty by making it easier for audiences to access relevant content. Additionally, using similes, analogies, and storytelling can help demystify complex crypto concepts, making them more relatable and understandable. Podcasters have a unique opportunity to facilitate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency by providing clear and concise information. By doing so, they empower audiences to make informed decisions, fulfilling a crucial responsibility in the crypto space.

According to BlockBeats, a report by Galaxy Research highlights that the crypto lending market is showing signs of recovery, particularly in the decentralized sector, despite remaining below pre-2022 levels. As of the end of 2024, the total market size reached $36.5 billion, including loans backed by crypto-collateralized stablecoins. This marks a significant decline from the $64.4 billion peak during the 2021 bull market, driven by speculative fervor. The downturn in the market is attributed to the collapse of major lending institutions such as Celsius, BlockFi, and Genesis, leading to a few large players dominating the centralized finance (CeFi) lending space. The report notes that Tether holds the largest market share, followed by Galaxy and Ledn, with these three entities accounting for nearly 90% of the $11.2 billion in outstanding CeFi loans. CeFi loans have decreased by 68% from their peak of $34.8 billion in early 2022. In contrast, significant growth is occurring on-chain. Decentralized lending protocols, which allow users to borrow crypto assets by locking collateral, operate continuously without reliance on centralized entities and are expanding rapidly.

Binance,"Cryptocurrency Funding Rates Show Slight Increase Amid Bearish Sentiment for Some Tokens
According to BlockBeats, data from Coinglass indicates a slight rise in funding rates across major centralized and decentralized exchanges. Despite this increase, certain tokens continue to exhibit bearish trends. Funding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain balance between contract prices and the underlying asset prices, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the platform charging this fee. It serves to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts, ensuring contract prices remain close to the asset prices. A funding rate of 0.01% signifies a baseline rate. When the rate exceeds 0.01%, it suggests a general bullish market sentiment. Conversely, a rate below 0.005% indicates a bearish outlook.",04-15-2025

Binance,"El Salvador's Bitcoin Service Providers Face Operational Challenges
According to Cointelegraph, only 20 out of 181 Bitcoin service providers registered with El Salvador's central bank are currently operational, with the majority failing to comply with the country's Bitcoin Law requirements. Local media outlet El Mundo reported data from the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador, indicating that merely 11% of these providers are functional, while the rest are classified as non-operational. The data reveals that at least 22 non-operational providers have not met the essential requirements of the Bitcoin Law, which mandates rigorous supervision of financial systems. El Salvador's Bitcoin Law stipulates that service providers must maintain an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program, accurately record their assets, liabilities, and equity, and implement a cybersecurity program tailored to their services. Despite these requirements, 89% of the registered providers have not fulfilled these obligations to be deemed operational. However, a few firms, including the state-backed Chivo Wallet and companies like Crypto Trading & Investment and Fintech Américas, have met the legal criteria. In 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar, a move central to President Nayib Bukele's economic strategy. Recently, the country signed a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which involves scaling back some Bitcoin-related initiatives. As part of the deal, taxes will be paid in US dollars, and public institutions will limit their use of Bitcoin. On March 3, the IMF urged El Salvador to halt public sector Bitcoin purchases, yet President Bukele stated that the government would continue buying Bitcoin, seemingly contradicting the IMF agreement. The IMF deal has sparked speculation about whether El Salvador will revoke Bitcoin's status as legal tender. John Dennehy, a Bitcoin activist and educator based in El Salvador, mentioned in an X Space with Cointelegraph that a rollback law altering Bitcoin's legal status is expected to take effect on April 30.",04-15-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin's Potential Breakout as RSI Reaches New Highs
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of a potential breakout as its relative strength index (RSI) reaches its highest levels since January. The RSI, a key indicator of market momentum, suggests that BTC price gains may be on the horizon. Historically, Bitcoin bull runs have been preceded by specific RSI signals, and current daily timeframes indicate favorable conditions for a BTC price rebound. In recent weeks, BTC/USD has experienced lower lows, while the RSI has trended in the opposite direction, setting higher lows and indicating a bullish divergence. The daily RSI recently broke above the 50 midpoint, successfully retesting it as support before reaching new multimonth highs. This development has caught the attention of traders and analysts, including Rekt Capital, who noted the successful retest of support and the maintenance of a higher low in the RSI. Rekt Capital highlighted growing signs of a maturing bullish divergence, with the price just below a key downtrend. Another analyst, Kevin Svenson, observed promising signals on the weekly RSI, noting that confirmed weekly RSI breakouts have historically been reliable indicators of macro breakouts. He emphasized that full confirmation of this breakout is expected within days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin market participants are also monitoring a downward-sloping trendline that has been in place since January's all-time highs. Despite the bullish signals, some analysts remain cautious due to challenging macroeconomic conditions. The ongoing U.S. trade war and risk-asset volatility have created an environment where capital influx into Bitcoin is uncertain. Network economist Timothy Peterson recently highlighted that April's BTC price performance is below the median, attributing this to high interest rates and other market risk factors. He noted that this trend is unlikely to change soon. Other perspectives suggest that while April may be lackluster, bullish factors such as record global M2 money supply and a weakening U.S. dollar index could eventually support Bitcoin's growth. As always, readers are advised to conduct their own research and consider the risks involved in investment and trading decisions.",04-15-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin Market Dynamics Shift Amid Institutional Influence
According to BlockBeats, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan has observed a notable shift in the Bitcoin market dynamics. Unlike previous cycles characterized by rapid price surges and a significant influx of short-term holders, the current market remains unusually calm despite price increases. The proportion of Bitcoin held for one week to one month is significantly lower than in past cycles, indicating a lack of explosive new capital and participants. The change is attributed to several factors. Firstly, the nature of liquidity has evolved. The bull market of 2020–2021 occurred under an exceptional macroeconomic environment of near-zero interest rates and aggressive quantitative easing. Currently, the market is experiencing high interest rates and liquidity tightening, making large-scale price surges more challenging. Secondly, the market's leadership has shifted from retail investors to institutions. Since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the market has become more structured, with institutional capital exerting increasing influence. This has resulted in a ""stair-step"" gradual increase in Bitcoin prices, contrasting with the rapid and frenzied rallies of the past. As a result, the market appears more cautious. Given these structural changes, some on-chain indicators suggest that the current cycle may have peaked. This cycle might not follow the traditional ""boom-bust"" pattern. Instead, the market could be entering a longer, more complex structure. ETF inflows continue, and the macroeconomic environment may gradually ease, suggesting that 2025 could still offer significant market opportunities.",04-15-2025

Binance,"Ethereum's Potential Role in Decentralizing AI Platforms
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum presents a significant opportunity to address current challenges faced by artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, as highlighted by a former core Ethereum developer. Eric Connor, speaking on April 15, emphasized that Ethereum's most impactful moment in the mainstream could be linked to AI. He noted that while AI is rapidly transforming various aspects of life, it is hindered by issues such as opaque models, centralized data silos, and privacy concerns. These challenges, Connor argued, create a space for Ethereum to demonstrate its capabilities. Ethereum's blockchain offers transparency through verifiable smart contracts, decentralization to counteract tech monopolies, aligned incentives via token economies, and a built-in micropayment infrastructure. Smart contracts, in particular, can provide transparent records of AI model training processes and data sources, addressing the ""black box"" issue prevalent in AI. However, Connor acknowledged that major AI companies might resist open models due to their reliance on secrecy and control for profit. Despite this, the demand for transparency, fairness, and security is expected to grow, positioning Ethereum as a viable alternative. Connor further stated that Ethereum embodies openness, collaboration, and trust minimization—qualities essential for ethical and accountable AI. By developing the necessary tools, research, and real-world applications, Ethereum can encourage AI developers to adopt decentralized approaches, potentially leading to widespread adoption beyond the financial sector. This sentiment was echoed by Zain Jaffer, co-founder of Vungle, who earlier this year identified the decentralization of AI as the next frontier for cryptocurrency. Connor departed from the Ethereum community in January to focus on AI interests amid leadership concerns. Meanwhile, Ethereum's role in developing agentic AI, an emerging technology, is gaining attention. AI agents, which autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and adapt to changes, are increasingly utilizing the Ethereum blockchain. The blockchain offers advantages such as access to transparent, real-time data, true digital asset ownership, and the ability to execute transactions and interact with smart contracts. The Ethereum blog recently highlighted projects like Luna, an autonomous virtual influencer managing its own on-chain wallet; AIXBT, an AI agent providing crypto market analysis; and Botto, a decentralized autonomous artist creating NFTs through community voting. Additionally, projects like Bankr and HeyAnon are enhancing blockchain interactions with conversational interfaces, enabling users to manage wallets and execute transactions via simple chat commands.",04-15-2025

Binance,"Northern Mariana Islands Governor Vetoes Stablecoin Legislation
According to Cointelegraph, the governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, Arnold Palacios, has vetoed legislation that would have allowed the local government of Tinian, a small island in the Pacific U.S. territory, to launch a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. In a letter dated April 11, Palacios expressed concerns over the bill, citing several legal issues and potential unconstitutionality. The legislation primarily focused on issuing licenses for internet casinos, aiming to regulate activities that could not be confined to Tinian, which has a population of just over 2,000 and relies heavily on tourism. The bill, introduced in February by Republican Northern Marianas Senator Jude Hofschneider, sought to amend local laws to permit internet-only casino licenses. It included a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage, and redeem a ""Tinian Stable Token."" The proposal received unanimous approval from the four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature on March 12. However, Governor Palacios did not address the stablecoin aspect directly in his veto, instead focusing on the bill's attempt to regulate an industry that could cross jurisdictional boundaries. He criticized the measure for lacking robust enforcement mechanisms to prevent illegal gaming activities. The vetoed bill represented a missed opportunity for Tinian to become the first U.S. government entity to issue a stablecoin, potentially ahead of Wyoming, where Governor Mark Gordon announced plans for a state-backed stablecoin launch in July. The proposed stablecoin, named the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD), was intended to be fully backed by cash and U.S. Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury. The Tinian government had selected Marianas Rai Corporation, a tech services firm based in Saipan, to provide the infrastructure for issuing and redeeming MUSD and developing its ecosystem. The MUSD was planned to launch on the eCash blockchain, a network that evolved from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash. The launch was set to coincide with Google's $1 billion initiative to route fiber-optic subsea cables from the mainland U.S. through Tinian to Japan, enhancing internet connectivity.

Binance,"Meta Receives EU Approval for AI Training Using Public Social Media Content
According to Cointelegraph, Meta has been granted permission by the European Union's data regulator to utilize publicly shared content from its social media platforms for training its artificial intelligence models. This decision allows Meta to incorporate posts and comments from adult users across its platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as interactions with its AI assistant, to enhance its AI capabilities. In a blog post dated April 14, Meta emphasized the importance of training its generative AI models on diverse data to comprehend the intricate nuances and complexities of European communities. Meta highlighted the significance of understanding dialects, colloquialisms, hyper-local knowledge, and the unique ways different countries employ humor and sarcasm on its products. However, the company clarified that private messages between friends and family, as well as public data from EU account holders under the age of 18, remain excluded from AI training. Users have the option to opt out of having their data used for AI training through a form that Meta will provide via in-app notifications and email, ensuring it is accessible and user-friendly. The approval comes after Meta faced a temporary halt in its AI training plans last July due to complaints from privacy advocacy group None of Your Business in 11 European countries. These complaints led the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) to request a pause until a review was conducted. The concerns centered around Meta's privacy policy changes, which allegedly allowed the use of personal posts, private images, and online tracking data for AI training. Meta has now received confirmation from the European Data Protection Commission that its AI training approach complies with legal obligations, and it continues to engage constructively with the IDPC. Meta's approach aligns with practices adopted by other tech giants like Google and OpenAI, which have already utilized data from European users for AI model training. Meanwhile, an Irish data regulator initiated a cross-border investigation into Google Ireland Limited last September to assess compliance with EU data protection laws during AI model development. Similarly, X faced scrutiny and agreed to cease using personal data from EU and European Economic Area users for training its AI chatbot Grok.

Binance,"Zoom Security Concerns Arise After Crypto Theft Incident
According to Cointelegraph, the CEO of Emblem Vault, Jake Gallen, has issued a warning to users of the video conferencing platform Zoom following a significant security breach. Gallen, who is also a podcaster and NFT collector, reported that a cybercriminal known as “ELUSIVE COMET” stole over $100,000 worth of his personal digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ether, through a sophisticated attack. The incident began on April 11, when Gallen experienced a complete compromise of his computer systems, resulting in the loss of his cryptocurrency holdings from various wallets. He revealed that the attack was facilitated through Zoom, where malware was installed on his computer during a call with a YouTube personality. This malware, identified as “GOOPDATE,” was used to steal credentials and access his crypto wallets. Gallen has been collaborating with cybersecurity firm The Security Alliance (SEAL) to investigate the ongoing threat posed by ELUSIVE COMET, who employs advanced social engineering tactics to deceive victims into installing malicious software. Gallen recounted that the attack occurred during an interview arranged with “Tactical Investing,” a verified X account claiming to be the founder and CEO of Fraction Mining. During the interview, the other party kept their screen off, allowing the malware installation. SEAL's research indicates that Zoom's default settings enable meeting participants to request remote control access, which can be exploited if users are not cautious. NFT collector Leonidas confirmed these settings and advised those in the crypto industry to disable remote access to prevent unauthorized control of their computers. SEAL security researcher Samczsun emphasized the importance of social engineering in these attacks, noting that victims must be manipulated into granting access. Despite attempts to reach Zoom for comment, no immediate response was received. The hackers also managed to access Gallen's Ledger wallet, despite his limited use and secure handling of the password. Additionally, they compromised his X account to target other potential victims through private messages.

Binance,"Crypto Lending Market Sees Significant Recovery in DeFi Sector
According to Cointelegraph, the crypto lending market has experienced a notable shift, with decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing showing a remarkable recovery despite the overall market downturn. The market, which allows borrowers to use their crypto assets as collateral for loans, has seen its size decrease significantly from its peak of $64.4 billion in 2021 to $36.5 billion by the end of 2024, marking a decline of over 43%. This downturn is largely attributed to the collapse of several centralized finance (CeFi) lenders, including Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi, and Voyager, which filed for bankruptcy as crypto valuations plummeted. The downfall of these CeFi lenders led to a dramatic 78% reduction in the lending market size, with CeFi lending experiencing an 82% drop in open borrows. Despite this, DeFi lending has shown a robust recovery, with open borrows increasing nearly tenfold from the bear market low of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $19.1 billion by the end of 2024. This 959% increase over eight quarters highlights the resilience of DeFi platforms, which have benefited from their permissionless nature and ability to withstand the market chaos that affected major CeFi lenders. Galaxy Digital's research associate, Zack Pokorny, noted that DeFi borrowing has outpaced CeFi lending recovery due to the continued operation of blockchain-based applications, which were not forced to close like their CeFi counterparts. As of now, outstanding CeFi borrows stand at $11.2 billion, a 68% decrease from the peak of $34.8 billion in 2022. The three largest CeFi lenders—Tether, Galaxy, and Ledn—dominate the market, accounting for 88.6% of the total CeFi lending market and 27% of the overall crypto lending market. This shift underscores the growing importance of DeFi in the crypto lending landscape, as it continues to recover and expand despite the challenges faced by traditional CeFi lenders.",04-14-2025

Binance,"Trump's Tariffs Pose Challenges to Federal Reserve's Inflation Goals
According to BlockBeats, U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have increased consumer prices in the United States, complicating the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation. Economists warn that expectations from businesses and workers about future prices can become self-fulfilling. Ignoring these expectations or dismissing them as temporary is not advisable, as the Federal Reserve's credibility is crucial, reflected in stable long-term inflation expectations. Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins recently highlighted that the impact of tariffs might be more extensive than anticipated. Prior to Trump's tariff announcement, the Federal Reserve had already lowered growth forecasts and raised inflation predictions. Several officials have since warned that inflation could reach 4% this year, providing policymakers with a reason to delay interest rate cuts despite growing concerns about economic slowdown. Trump's comprehensive tariffs could transform a one-time price shock into sustained inflationary pressure, threatening the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Recent data indicates that long-term inflation expectations have risen to a 30-year high, with consumers anticipating a 6.7% increase in future prices and a 4.4% rise over the next 5-10 years. American households have yet to recover from the post-pandemic price surge, and public trust in the Federal Reserve is being tested.",04-14-2025

Binance,"McDonald's Faces Shareholder Proposal to Invest in Bitcoin
According to BlockBeats, McDonald's is set to hold its shareholder meeting next month, where a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, suggests the company consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, this proposal has not gained support from the company's management.The think tank argues that Bitcoin offers greater potential for appreciation and liquidity compared to real estate, which has traditionally been viewed as a more stable investment than cash and bonds. They referenced a famous quote from former McDonald's CFO and President Harry Sonneborn, emphasizing the need for the company to explore assets with higher growth potential.The proposal warns that more companies are incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, and McDonald's risks falling behind if it does not follow suit.Despite this, McDonald's has shown reluctance. The company's legal representatives have contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to confirm whether they can exclude the proposal from the upcoming shareholder meeting agenda without facing enforcement action. The SEC responded last month, supporting McDonald's right to omit the proposal, stating it pertains to routine business operations and does not require a shareholder vote.This indicates that the proposal is unlikely to be discussed at the upcoming meeting.The trend of companies adopting Bitcoin is growing, yet opinions remain divided. For instance, at Microsoft's shareholder meeting last year, a proposal to invest 1% of the company's total assets in Bitcoin was rejected by the board.As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the question of whether and how companies should integrate digital assets into their financial strategies is becoming increasingly significant.

Binance,"Social Security Administration Adopts Social Media for Public Communication Amid Workforce Changes
According to ShibDaily, the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) has announced a significant change in its communication strategy, opting to use X (formerly Twitter) as its sole platform for engaging with the public and media. This decision follows substantial staff reductions within the agency. SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis revealed in a recent managerial meeting that the agency will discontinue issuing press releases and 'dear colleague' letters, which have traditionally been used to update the media and public about program and service changes. Kerr-Davis emphasized that X will now serve as the primary communication tool for the agency. The SSA has historically relied on 'dear colleague' letters to communicate with advocacy groups and third-party organizations that assist individuals in accessing benefits. These letters typically included updates on various topics, such as new identity verification protocols and improvements in the agency’s death record accuracy. With the discontinuation of these communication tools, SSA employees may face challenges in staying informed about internal developments, especially since government security protocols require special requests to access social media on work computers. This shift to social media-only communication could hinder employees' ability to remain informed and effectively perform their duties. The transition to social media updates may also pose challenges for benefit recipients who rely on traditional communication methods to stay informed about accessing services. Wired reported concerns from employees about the practicality of expecting senior citizens to use the platform for critical updates. Another employee noted that the shift limits public access to important information, complicating efforts to stay informed about changes. White House spokesperson Liz Huston countered the report, asserting that the SSA is actively communicating with beneficiaries and stakeholders. Huston clarified that there has not been a workforce reduction but rather a reassignment of staff from regional offices to front-line help to optimize resource allocation. U.S. President Donald Trump remains committed to protecting Social Security. Wired also highlighted that SSA's regional offices are experiencing significant staff reductions, with sources indicating cuts of up to 87 percent. These offices are responsible for various functions, including IT support, policy oversight, labor relations, accessibility accommodations, and communications. Since February, the agency has reportedly eliminated approximately 7,000 positions, as noted by The Washington Post. Kerr-Davis mentioned that the agency's restructuring might weaken its ability to address fraud, a concern emphasized by Elon Musk’s newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",04-14-2025
Binance,"Demand for Hedging Against Dollar Depreciation Reaches Five-Year High
According to BlockBeats, the demand for hedging against potential dollar depreciation has surged to a five-year high due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which may undermine America's economic exceptionalism and weaken the dollar. Institutional data reveals that the three-month risk reversal index, which measures the spread between bullish and bearish options on the dollar against 12 major currencies, has dropped to its lowest level since March 2020, during the peak of the global pandemic. Last week, this index fell below zero for the first time in five years, indicating a greater demand for bearish options that benefit from a weaker dollar compared to bullish options that benefit from a stronger dollar. ""The aversion to holding dollars remains dominant in the market,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne's Pepperstone Group Ltd. ""The questions surrounding the dollar are not a matter of a single day but rather indicative of significant potential structural changes.""",04-14-2025
Binance,"Advancements in Gene Editing and IVG Bring New Possibilities and Ethical Questions
According to ShibDaily, recent advancements in in-vitro gametogenesis (IVG) and gene-editing technologies are bringing the concept of gene-edited human embryos closer to reality. The CRISPR-Cas9 tool, known for its precision in editing DNA, is at the forefront of making heritable gene editing a viable option in the near future. This technology allows scientists to make specific changes to DNA, such as correcting mutations or adding new genetic material. Researchers have made significant progress in IVG, creating early-stage germ cell precursors from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These precursors, known as pro-spermatogonia and pro-oogonia, closely resemble natural germ cells at both genetic and epigenetic levels. This breakthrough could provide new fertility options for individuals unable to conceive naturally by enabling the creation of eggs or sperm from their own cells. In addition, Yale researchers have developed advanced mouse models using CRISPR technology to study gene interactions in the immune system's response to diseases, including cancer. A study published in Nature Biomedical Engineering highlights how gene-editing tools can precisely modify DNA or RNA, aiding in the understanding of gene contributions to various diseases. The researchers introduced a method using CRISPR-Cas12a to analyze multiple genetic changes simultaneously, particularly in immune system responses. While these advancements hold promise for selecting specific traits in future children, they also raise ethical, social, and legal concerns. The potential to alter physical or cognitive traits could lead to debates about fairness and the implications of creating ""designer babies."" CRISPR technology recently gained public attention following Colossal Biosciences' announcement of a breakthrough in reviving the extinct dire wolf. The company used DNA from ancient fossils to create a close genetic approximation of the dire wolf, a species popularized by George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones. Through 20 precise genetic edits to the DNA of the gray wolf, the dire wolf's closest living relative, Colossal Biosciences successfully created three viable dire wolf pups. These pups, featuring enhanced traits like snowy white coats, now reside in a protected preserve. Dire wolves, once real animals that roamed the Americas, are believed to have gone extinct around 10,000 years ago. While these scientific advancements offer exciting possibilities, they also prompt discussions about the ethical implications of such technologies.",04-14-2025
Binance,"Google Introduces Agent-to-Agent Protocol to Enhance AI Interoperability
According to ShibDaily, Google has unveiled a new open protocol named Agent2Agent (A2A) to facilitate secure communication between AI agents, marking a significant advancement in AI interoperability. The announcement was made on Google's developer blog, highlighting the company's efforts to address challenges faced during the deployment of large, multi-agent frameworks for clients. The A2A protocol has garnered support from over 50 technology partners, including Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, Langchain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG, and Workday, along with leading service providers such as Accenture, BCG, Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey, PwC, TCS, and Wipro. Google's A2A protocol is designed to enable seamless interaction among AI agents across various platforms, facilitating secure information exchange and coordinated actions within enterprise environments. By adopting this protocol, developers can create interoperable agents that connect and collaborate with others built using A2A. The protocol also introduces a machine-readable ""Agent Card"" formatted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), allowing client agents to identify the most suitable agent for specific tasks. Once connected, agents can exchange messages containing context, responses, digital artifacts, or direct user instructions, enhancing collaboration and task execution. The A2A protocol is intended to work alongside Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing useful tools and context to AI agents. Built on Google's experience with large-scale AI systems, A2A aims to address common issues businesses encounter when using multiple agents simultaneously. For enterprises, it offers a consistent method to manage these agents across different platforms and cloud services. Google emphasizes that universal compatibility is crucial for unlocking the full potential of collaborative AI agents. As AI agents become more advanced and widely adopted, protocols like A2A could play a pivotal role in shaping their interaction and collaboration. By focusing on interoperability, Google seeks to establish a shared foundation that enables diverse agents from various providers and platforms to work together seamlessly.

According to BlockBeats, global markets experienced significant volatility amid uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and expectations of Federal Reserve easing. Following a roller-coaster week, U.S. stocks rebounded strongly, with the three major indices achieving their best weekly performance in over a year. The S&P 500 rose by 5.7%, marking its best week since November 2023, while the Dow Jones increased by 4.95% and the Nasdaq by 7.29%. The tech sector's leading index surged by 8.95%, with Nvidia standing out with a weekly gain of 17.62%.In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin initially plummeted to near $74,000 due to safe-haven demand triggered by the tariff conflict. However, market sentiment improved as Trump temporarily delayed reciprocal tariffs and announced an exemption list, leading Bitcoin to rebound and surpass $86,000. At the time of reporting, Bitcoin was priced at $84,408, reflecting a weekly increase of nearly 7%. Other altcoins also saw significant rebounds, although Ethereum's overall performance remained weak.In the foreign exchange and commodities markets, Trump's aggressive tariff measures weakened the dollar's safe-haven status, causing the dollar index to fall below the 100 mark to its lowest level since 2022, with a weekly decline of 2.9%, the largest in nearly two years. Oil prices fell for the second consecutive week due to demand concerns, while heightened safe-haven demand pushed gold prices to new highs, with spot gold rising by 6.48% over the week.Despite last week's market rebound amid tariff policy easing, Trump's latest statements denying tariff 'exemptions' indicate that policy uncertainty remains a major risk.

Binance,"Crypto's TPS Obsession: A Misguided Race Ignoring Real User Needs
According to BlockBeats, the cryptocurrency industry's focus on achieving high transactions per second (TPS) is criticized as a misleading pursuit that overlooks genuine user needs. Projects often exaggerate lab data to attract funding and attention, sacrificing decentralization, security, and practicality to solve problems that few care about. The article calls for a focus on meaningful blockchain applications built to scale according to actual use cases, rather than chasing impressive but hollow numbers. New Layer 1 or Layer 2 projects frequently claim to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second, but these figures are often unrealistic. The competition for scalability has become an embarrassing contest in the crypto world, with each new protocol claiming higher TPS than the last, regardless of whether these speeds are achievable outside of controlled environments like AWS testnets or relevant to real-world applications. Visa, a global payment giant, processes about 1,700 transactions per second on average, with a theoretical maximum of 24,000 TPS, a capacity it has never needed in decades of operation. In contrast, most blockchain projects struggle to attract even 100 daily active users. If a project's Discord emojis outnumber its on-chain transactions, it may be addressing an imaginary problem. The obsession with theoretical throughput has hidden costs. It often leads to disguised centralization, sacrificing decentralization for marketing numbers. Security is compromised as shortcuts are taken in the rush to scale, creating vulnerabilities. Talented engineers are diverted from building what users truly need to optimizing synthetic benchmarks. Moreover, the lab numbers touted in marketing often crumble under real-world conditions. This fixation on extreme scalability is driven by the need to justify massive funding and stand out in a crowded market of over 5,000 blockchains. User needs are an afterthought, with the real goal being to convince retail investors of a project's ultimate solution status, while venture capitalists amplify the TPS narrative. For those genuinely building in this space, the article advises focusing on what only blockchain can achieve, designing economic models that don't rely on constant new user acquisition, creating user-friendly interfaces, and scaling according to actual use cases rather than for impressive presentations. When a project boasts about handling hundreds of thousands of TPS, it's crucial to ask what these transactions are doing, who is generating them, and for what purpose. True innovation lies not in theoretical performance but in building what people genuinely need, scaled appropriately to demand. Anything else is merely expensive performance art disguised as technology.",04-14-2025

The U.S. Treasury market plays a crucial role in global finance, influencing everything from mortgage rates to corporate bond yields.

According to BlockBeats, Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino shared on social media that the market is expected to react positively to the 'Tim Apple tariff exemption.' The Nasdaq may experience significant gains as the exemption also applies to Nvidia and other major tech companies. Sources indicate that, from a political standpoint, this move further highlights the weak arguments of U.S. Commerce Secretary Lutnick and U.S. Trade Advisor Navarro, who have claimed that high tariffs and other restrictions can 'magically' create jobs domestically. If this were true, why exempt companies that heavily rely on foreign labor and components? Investors and CEOs generally view this tariff plan as one of the worst policy implementations in recent years.

Binance,"NFT Trader Faces Potential Six-Year Sentence for Tax Evasion
According to Cointelegraph, a non-fungible token (NFT) trader, Waylon Wilcox, could face up to six years in prison after admitting to underreporting nearly $13 million in profits from trading CryptoPunks. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania revealed that Wilcox, 45, pleaded guilty to filing false income tax returns for the 2021 and 2022 tax years. On April 9, Wilcox admitted to two counts of filing false individual income tax returns, as stated by federal prosecutors in an April 11 press release. In April 2022, Wilcox filed a false tax return for the 2021 tax year, underreporting his income by approximately $8.5 million and reducing his tax liability by about $2.1 million. Later, in October 2023, he submitted another false return for the 2022 fiscal year, underreporting his income by an estimated $4.6 million and decreasing his tax due by nearly $1.1 million. The total maximum penalty for these offenses under federal law is up to six years of imprisonment, a term of supervised release, and a fine. However, the specifics of his sentencing remain undetermined. Wilcox was involved in buying and selling 97 pieces of the CryptoPunk NFT collection, which is the largest in the industry with a market capitalization of $687 million. In 2021, he sold 62 CryptoPunk NFTs for a gain of about $7.4 million but reported significantly less on his taxes. In 2022, he sold 35 more CryptoPunks for $4.9 million. The Department of Justice noted that Wilcox intentionally selected “no” when asked if he had engaged in digital asset transactions on both filings. IRS Criminal Investigation is dedicated to uncovering complex financial schemes involving virtual currencies and NFT transactions designed to conceal taxable income, according to Philadelphia Field Office Special Agent Yury Kruty. The case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and its Criminal Investigation Department. Crypto tax laws have gained global attention, especially after the IRS introduced new regulations in June 2024, requiring U.S. crypto transactions to be subject to third-party tax reporting. Since January, centralized crypto exchanges and other brokers must report digital asset sales and exchanges. On April 10, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a resolution overturning a Biden-era law that would have required decentralized finance protocols to report transactions to the IRS. Set to take effect in 2027, the IRS DeFi broker rule would have expanded reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms.

According to BlockBeats, Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman have introduced the Clean Cloud Act of 2025 to the U.S. Senate. The proposed legislation aims to regulate carbon emissions from cryptocurrency mining facilities and AI data centers, with a goal of imposing fines on facilities using non-renewable energy by 2035. The bill seeks to amend the Clean Air Act, requiring data centers with energy capacities exceeding 100 kilowatts to adhere to regional emission limits set by the Department of Energy's National Transmission Needs Study. The proposed emission caps will vary by region, with standards established by the end of 2025 and decreasing by 11% annually until reaching zero by 2035. Companies exceeding these limits will face inflation-adjusted fines, which cannot be passed on to consumers. The collected fines will be allocated to local governments to mitigate rising residential electricity costs and support clean energy initiatives. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's Democratic team expressed on the X platform that while cryptocurrency and AI data centers could support clean energy, they currently increase fossil fuel consumption and elevate household electricity expenses. The Clean Cloud Act aims to ensure these profitable industries take responsibility, maintaining leadership in AI development and climate safety.

Binance,"Cryptocurrency Market Surges Following U.S. Tariff Exemption Policy
According to PANews, U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tariff exemption policy over the weekend has led to a significant surge in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin reached a high of $85,900, overcoming resistance around $83,000, as the technology sector's burden from high import costs eased considerably compared to 24 hours earlier. Historically, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin tend to move in tandem with tech stocks, especially when investor sentiment shifts towards riskier assets. Trump's tariff exemption policy has lifted the cloud over the tech industry, indirectly alleviating pressure on the crypto market. Within hours of the announcement, Bitcoin rebounded to its weekend peak. The exemption of tariffs on semiconductors and computer components is seen as a long-term benefit for the crypto ecosystem. These components are crucial for cryptocurrency mining, blockchain infrastructure, and AI-based crypto tool development. Continuous and affordable production and supply of these parts ensure the smooth operation of the crypto industry, including exchanges, wallet providers, and tech startups focused on blockchain solutions. Despite the complexity and unpredictability of Trump's trade policies, the targeted exemption for tech equipment provides clear short-term policy direction and eases market pressure. Investors are now more confident that inflation in consumer electronics will be avoided, and companies won't be forced to raise prices or cut innovation. While this doesn't signal the end of tariff concerns, it does alleviate one of the major worries facing the cryptocurrency sector. The crypto market has shown a moderate bullish response, and the stock market is expected to rise on Monday, further boosting Bitcoin and altcoins.

The firm highlighted the investor's substantial loss, noting that while the sale resulted in a 500 ETH loss, equivalent to $774,000, the actual financial impact was a $9.73 million loss. This discrepancy arose because the price of ETH had fallen by 57% from $3,509 at the time of purchase to the sale date. Despite the significant loss, the transaction remains the largest NFT sale in the past 30 days, according to CryptoSlam data. This sale occurs amid a period of stagnation for NFTs, with Ethereum's NFT trading volume dropping over 53% in the past month and Polygon's volume decreasing by 41%. The CryptoPunk collection experienced a brief 13% increase in floor price following rumors that Yuga Labs, the collection's owner, might be considering selling its intellectual property. However, the broader blue-chip NFT market continues to struggle, with top collections significantly down from their 2021 peaks. CryptoPunks currently have a floor price of about 43 ETH, or $68,000, marking a decline of over 61% from their record high of 113.9 ETH in October 2021. Similarly, the Bored Ape Yacht Club's floor price has dropped 89%, and the Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection is down 93%, according to NFTpricefloor data. In contrast, the Pudgy Penguin collection has defied the trend, reaching a new all-time high of over 25 Ether on December 16, 2024, and achieving the highest sales volume of over $72 million in the first quarter of 2025, as reported by Cointelegraph on March 28. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission concluded its three-year investigation into Yuga Labs at the beginning of March.

Binance,"U.S. Customs Disruption May Be Strategic Amid Global Trade Tensions
According to BlockBeats, institutional analysts suggest that the recent U.S. Customs disruption might be more than a mere software glitch. The term ""glitch"" could be a strategic smokescreen, aimed not at fixing a malfunctioning system but at buying time during a period of high-risk adjustments in global trade and capital flows. As U.S. President Donald Trump's significant tariff measures cause ripples across global supply chains, the sudden ""glitch"" has halted tariff data processing. This pause provides key stakeholders, including clearinghouses, freight forwarders, the U.S. Treasury, and Customs, an opportunity to reassess pricing and strategies before any new rates are implemented. It may also serve as a form of information disruption akin to a wartime fog strategy. By freezing tariff exemption tracking and reducing transparency on who receives exemptions, the U.S. administration and Treasury gain a relatively quiet period—ranging from hours to days—to evaluate market reactions and intervene if necessary, without media exposure of their actions. This can be seen as a preemptive firewall against liquidity crises or geopolitical panic, rather than a system-level failure.",04-12-2025

Solana ETF Approval Speculation Gains MomentumThe most significant catalyst behind Solana’s price increase is growing optimism around a potential Solana spot ETF following the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new U.S. SEC Chair.Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto stance, has spurred market speculation that altcoin ETFs—including Solana ETFs—may see a smoother path to regulatory approval.According to Polymarket, the odds of a SOL ETF approval by 2025 have jumped to 76%, up from 65% in early January.Several leading asset managers have submitted applications for Solana ETFs, including:GrayscaleVanEck21SharesBitwiseCanary CapitalThe approval of a Solana ETF would likely increase institutional interest and liquidity in SOL, driving more capital inflows into the ecosystem.2.

Bullish RSI Divergence Suggests UptrendTechnical indicators on Solana’s daily chart are signaling a bullish divergence, reinforcing today’s upside.The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is forming higher lows while the price previously made lower lows—typically a bullish reversal signal.If this trend continues, SOL price could target the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near $130, acting as the next short-term resistance.Solana's Path ForwardWith bullish momentum building from regulatory optimism and market mechanics, Solana appears poised for further gains.Key levels to watch:Immediate resistance: $130 (50-day SMA)Support zone: $115–$118Breakout target: $140+ if ETF sentiment strengthensAs crypto traders eye ETF-related headlines and funding rate shifts, Solana remains one of the top altcoins to watch in April 2025, according to Cointelegraph.",04-12-2025

Binance,"Fed's Kashkari Comments on Market Trends Amid Trade Tensions
According to Odaily, Federal Reserve official Neel Kashkari stated on Friday that recent market trends indicate investors are moving away from the United States, traditionally considered the safest investment destination, amid escalating trade tensions under U.S. President Donald Trump. Kashkari noted that contrary to typical expectations, the U.S. dollar has depreciated against global currencies as U.S. Treasury yields rise. He explained that usually, an increase in tariffs would lead to a stronger dollar. However, the current depreciation suggests a shift in investor preferences. Kashkari remarked that global investors have historically viewed the U.S. as the best investment location, which would typically result in a trade deficit. The current trend of declining asset yields in the U.S. reflects this perception. Kashkari further mentioned that if the trade deficit decreases, investors might perceive the U.S. as less attractive, leading to rising bond yields. Despite these observations, he emphasized that the market is experiencing 'pressure' rather than severe disruption.",04-11-2025
Binance,"Swedish Proposal to Include Bitcoin in National Reserves Gains Attention
According to BlockBeats, Swedish lawmaker Rickard Nordin has submitted an open letter to the finance minister, proposing the inclusion of Bitcoin in the country's foreign exchange reserves. Inspired by U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order on Bitcoin reserves, the proposal suggests a 'budget-neutral' implementation. Nordin emphasized that while Sweden traditionally maintains a conservative approach to foreign reserves, primarily holding foreign currencies and gold, the rapid development of digital assets cannot be ignored. Bitcoin is increasingly recognized by international institutions as a hedge against inflation and is widely used as a payment method globally.Meanwhile, the governor of the Czech National Bank is also considering incorporating Bitcoin into the strategy for diversifying foreign exchange reserves. However, the European Union remains largely silent on Bitcoin legislation, focusing more on advancing the digital euro. According to the founder of venture capital firm DFG, the EU's lukewarm stance on Bitcoin stems from its prioritization of the digital euro, despite recent issues with the European Central Bank's T2 payment system raising concerns about its digital currency management capabilities. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated plans to introduce the digital euro in October, ensuring its coexistence with cash and addressing privacy concerns through a 'pseudo-anonymous' design. This contrasts sharply with U.S. policy, where the Trump administration firmly opposes central bank digital currencies, explicitly banning the issuance and circulation of any dollar-based CBDC.",04-11-2025

Binance,"Inflation Eases as U.S. Bond Market Faces Challenges
According to BlockBeats, the recently released March Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a year-on-year increase of 2.1%, marking the largest monthly decline since 2020. This development provides the Federal Reserve with potential leeway for policy adjustments in its upcoming May meeting. BRN analyst Valentin Fournier noted that the easing inflation pressures might prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts and relax financial conditions. Following the CPI data release, Bitcoin stabilized at $80,000. However, spot ETFs recorded net outflows for the sixth consecutive day, the longest streak since February, indicating challenges in sustaining bullish momentum. On a positive note, Wall Street crypto funds may soon experience inflows, driven by factors such as cooling inflation, peak tariffs, and regulatory easing expectations with the appointment of new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. While the market processes the positive inflation news, the U.S. bond market signals concern. The 10-year Treasury yield surpassed 4.5%, the highest since 2022, reflecting investor anxiety over the government's debt repayment capabilities. Douro Labs CEO Mike Cahill highlighted the complex scenario of low inflation data, bond market turmoil, and a 90-day tariff pause, exposing structural imbalances in the global economic system. Despite the Trump administration's announcement of a 90-day suspension on new tariffs, market concerns persist. Amberdata's research director Mike Marshall pointed out that the calming effect of the tariff pause is overestimated, as trade tensions continue to escalate. This policy uncertainty is reshaping capital flows, with predictions that funds will shift from the fragile bond market to digital assets with practical utility and programmable stability in the long term. Amid the dual signals of easing inflation and bond market crisis, the Federal Reserve's decision-making is in flux. BRN analyst Valentin Fournier believes that short-term pain may be exaggerated, and there is room for positive diplomatic efforts in trade tensions, potentially leading to breakthroughs in the coming weeks. However, the market is more focused on structural changes, with the policy direction of the new SEC Chairman being a potential key variable. If the promised 'crypto-friendly regulatory framework' is implemented as expected, it could instill institutional confidence in the crypto asset market.",04-11-2025
Binance,"UK and US Intensify Scrutiny on Stablecoins Amid Financial Stability Concerns
According to ShibDaily, United Kingdom regulators have increased their scrutiny of stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency industry, citing potential risks to the country's financial system and monetary stability. During meetings on April 4 and April 8, the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) highlighted a significant rise in stablecoin and unbacked cryptocurrency activities over the past year. The FPC issued a warning about the potential threats these developments could pose to financial stability, emphasizing concerns related to the growing adoption of digital assets without clear backing. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and its central bank are collaborating to develop regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, aiming to enhance financial resilience. The committee noted that a crucial factor in the resilience of stablecoins is the liquidity, credit, and market risks of their backing assets, which are essential to ensure timely redemptions at par, even during periods of stress. Committee members expressed concerns that the expansion of stablecoin use beyond cryptocurrency settlements could significantly impact both retail and wholesale cross-border payments. Specifically, the adoption of stablecoins by households and small to medium-sized enterprises for cross-border transactions could lead to ""currency substitution,"" increasing counterparty risks. As the UK intensifies its scrutiny of stablecoins, similar regulatory efforts are underway in the United States, where lawmakers are working to establish clear frameworks for stablecoin usage and its potential impact on financial stability. The U.S. government is taking steps to regulate the growing stablecoin market with two key legislative proposals aimed at addressing potential risks to financial stability and consumer protection. The GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act are two bills currently progressing through Congress, each proposing a distinct approach to regulating stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to traditional currencies, often the U.S. dollar. These bills focus on ensuring that stablecoins are properly backed, provide transparency, and comply with necessary safeguards. Both pieces of legislation reflect growing concerns within the U.S. government regarding the role of stablecoins in the broader financial system. As the bills continue to advance, they emphasize the need for clear regulatory frameworks to ensure that stablecoins do not pose undue risks to the financial system or allow for potential abuses. The outcome of this legislative effort will likely shape the future of stablecoins and digital assets in the U.S. financial landscape.",04-11-2025
Binance,"OpenAI Countersues Elon Musk Amid Ongoing Legal Dispute
According to ShibDaily, OpenAI has filed a countersuit against Elon Musk, the owner of X, intensifying a legal battle that began when Musk initiated litigation against the AI research group last week. The lawsuit, submitted on April 9 in the Northern District of California, accuses Musk of attempting to transform OpenAI into a public benefit corporation while maintaining its for-profit status. The filing also claims that Musk withdrew from OpenAI after the organization declined to merge with his company, Tesla. Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges that Musk did not fulfill his $1 billion funding commitment to OpenAI. Instead, following the launch of ChatGPT, Musk established his own AI company, xAI. The lawsuit states, ""Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed. He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead—not for humanity but for Elon Musk."" The filing further accuses Musk of using various tactics, including press attacks and legal claims, to harm OpenAI. OpenAI announced its countersuit in a post on X, describing Musk's actions as ""bad-faith tactics"" aimed at undermining the organization and taking control of its AI advancements for personal gain. The organization has requested that the court prevent Musk from continuing his attacks and hold him accountable for the damage caused. A jury trial is scheduled for the spring of next year. According to Reuters, Musk's legal team referenced a previous $97.4 billion unsolicited acquisition offer led by Musk, which OpenAI declined. Musk's lawyer, Marc Toberoff, stated, ""Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do, they would have seen how serious it was.

According to PANews, Brazil's Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot project, Drex, is encountering difficulties due to reduced resources, leading to a slowdown in progress. The two major companies involved in designing privacy solutions for the project, Microsoft and Ernst & Young, have recently decreased their workforce dedicated to these efforts. This impasse is linked to the central bank's recent actions, which concluded the second phase of the Drex pilot without approving any submitted projects. The privacy proposals, which need to ensure transaction confidentiality while allowing regulatory review, have not met the central bank's requirements, causing the Drex project to stall. Ernst & Young, responsible for the Starlight privacy project, has lost three team members involved in developing the solution. Meanwhile, Microsoft, after significant resource investment last year, has reduced its participation in the ZKP Nova privacy proposal. However, Microsoft's partner, Hamsa, will continue testing and supporting ZKP Nova.

Bitcoin (BTC) failed to sustain above the critical $83,000 level this week, raising concerns about a potential liquidity grab and deeper retracement — especially amid growing macroeconomic tensions and renewed U.S.-China trade uncertainty.After briefly rebounding from its five-month low of $74,300 to reach $83,565 on April 9, Bitcoin has pulled back again, with traders now watching closely to see if BTC can hold the key psychological support at $80,000.Trump’s 90-Day Tariff Pause: Relief Rally or Bull Trap?Markets rallied after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a 90-day pause on global tariffs on April 9, triggering a wave of optimism. Bitcoin surged 7%, briefly topping $82,000, as fears of an immediate trade escalation cooled.However, the relief may be short-lived. While most countries received a 10% flat tariff, China was singled out with a 125% hike, prompting an 84% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods.“Should retaliation materialize in force, the exuberant rally could quickly morph into a classic bull trap,” warned QCP Capital in a note to investors.The uncertainty leaves BTC vulnerable to renewed risk-off sentiment if the tariff pause fails to de-escalate tensions.Inflation, Rate Hikes, and Recession Concerns Pressure BTC PriceMacroeconomic factors continue to pose a major challenge to Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Correlation with tech stocks means BTC is sensitive to monetary tightening and inflation.BTC dropped nearly 10% earlier this year during initial tariff threats.A deeper U.S.-China trade war or surprise rate hikes from the Federal Reserve could spook markets further.“Bitcoin has increasingly behaved like a risk asset, and any hawkish turn could trigger more downside,” analysts say.With the April 10 U.S. CPI report in focus, markets are hoping for a soft inflation print to offset the inflationary overhang of Trump’s blanket tariff policy.However, CME’s FedWatch Tool shows an 81.5% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged at the upcoming May 7 FOMC meeting — offering limited support to Bitcoin in the short term.Key Technical Levels to WatchAccording to Glassnode and market analysts:Support to hold:365-day MA: ~$76,000 — must hold to avoid downside momentumRealized price: ~$71,000True market mean: ~$65,000Resistance levels:200-day MA: ~$87,000111-day MA / STH cost basis: ~$93,000Previous ATH: $109,000“Bitcoin must reclaim $93,000 to reignite bullish momentum. Losing $76,000 would increase the risk of retesting $71,000 or even $65,000,” said analysts.Will Bitcoin Crash Again?While the 90-day tariff pause sparked a short-term bounce, the underlying macro backdrop — rising inflation, interest rate uncertainty, and geopolitical tension — continues to pressure Bitcoin.A failure to hold $80K could open the door to another leg down, possibly testing key support zones between $65,000–$71,000, according to confluence across on-chain price models.As BTC struggles to maintain momentum, market participants are bracing for more volatility, awaiting clearer signals from U.S. inflation data, Fed policy, and trade war developments, according to Cointelegraph.",04-11-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin Shows Signs of Potential Bottom Formation, Analysts Suggest
According to PANews, recent analysis indicates that Bitcoin may be exhibiting classic bottoming characteristics. On April 10, John Bollinger, the creator of the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator, shared insights on social media platform X, suggesting that Bitcoin bulls are signaling positive momentum. The Bollinger %b indicator hints at a potential price rebound, with the latest data suggesting Bitcoin might be forming a long-term bottom. Bollinger emphasized that his unique %b indicator is signaling a trend reversal through weekly analysis. This indicator assesses an asset's closing price relative to its position within the Bollinger Bands, which are based on a 20-period simple moving average and standard deviation. A notable pattern to watch is the W-shaped double bottom, which often indicates a reversal opportunity when the price initially drops below the lower band to form a low, followed by a higher low on a subsequent pullback. Bollinger confirmed to his followers that ""Bitcoin is forming a classic Bollinger W bottom pattern, but confirmation is still needed."" Despite these observations, both weekly and daily Bollinger Bands show no definitive trend change yet. Data reveals that Bitcoin's daily price continues to hover along the lower band, with the middle SMA acting as resistance. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Investments, noted similar technical patterns in the U.S. stock market, highlighting that the S&P 500 index has fallen from two standard deviations above the trend line to nearly two standard deviations below it. Although the index is in an oversold region, it has not yet reached historical extremes.",04-11-2025

Binance,"SEC and Ripple Pause Appeals in Anticipated XRP Settlement
According to Cointelegraph, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and blockchain payments firm Ripple have agreed to pause their appeals in the ongoing legal battle over XRP, indicating a potential move toward a final settlement. The decision to place the appeals in ""abeyance"" means that the proceedings are temporarily halted as both parties work towards a negotiated resolution of the case. This development was jointly announced in a court filing on April 10, highlighting the intention to conserve judicial and party resources. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had previously declared the end of the XRP case on March 19, and the recent filing suggests that the SEC is prepared to settle once Paul Atkins, the nominated and approved Chair, takes office. This speculation is supported by community discussions surrounding the case. The filing also nullifies Ripple's April 16 deadline to submit a brief in response to the SEC's January filing. Ripple's defense attorney, James Filan, confirmed in an April 10 post on X that the settlement is pending commission approval, and no brief will be filed on April 16. Legal experts have interpreted the SEC's willingness to pause the proceedings as a sign that the agency might be ready to drop the case once Atkins assumes his role as SEC Chair. The Senate confirmed Atkins as the new SEC chair on April 9, but the exact date of his swearing-in remains uncertain. Historical precedent suggests that Atkins could take office as soon as April 12, following the pattern set by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was sworn in three days after his confirmation in 2021.

Binance,"Bitcoin Price News: Recession Fears May Delay Bullish Momentum, Says 10x Research
While a potential U.S. recession may eventually trigger bullish conditions for Bitcoin (BTC), short-term downside risks remain, according to 10x Research head Markus Thielen.In a market report published on April 11, Thielen warned that Bitcoin investors may be prematurely celebrating the long-term gains a recession might bring.“Expecting a bullish impulse is too early,” Thielen stated, pointing to widening credit spreads that signal rising recessionary pressure within the U.S. economy.Bitcoin Faces Short-Term Headwinds Despite Long-Term PotentialBitcoin is currently trading at $81,252, up 2.4% in the past 24 hours, but Thielen says the digital asset could face near-term pressure.He explained that BTC typically sells off during initial Fed rate cuts or Chinese yuan devaluations — both of which are commonly seen during early recession stages. The reasoning is twofold: early rate cuts confirm economic weakness and initial easing may not deliver significant market support.“Normally, Bitcoin first sells off when China devalues or the Fed cuts, as the first cut might not be so impactful and also confirms economic weakness,” Thielen told Cointelegraph.Market Indicators Reflect Caution on Rate CutsThe core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.8% year-over-year in March — the lowest since March 2021.White House crypto and AI adviser David Sacks called for an immediate rate cut on April 10, citing subdued inflation data.However, CME Group’s FedWatch Tool suggests a 64.8% chance of no rate cut at the May FOMC meeting.While investors often associate rate cuts and monetary easing with rising asset prices — particularly crypto — Thielen emphasized that Bitcoin’s recovery may lag due to macro uncertainties, according to Cointelegraph.Widening Credit Spreads, Dollar Weakness Add PressureThielen noted that widening year-over-year credit spreads have historically signaled further downside risk for Bitcoin, as markets price in slower economic growth and financial stress.Simultaneously, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen to 100.337, down 2.92% over the past five days, reflecting growing concerns over dollar weakness.“The U.S. dollar has exited the room.

As the Trump administration’s 90-day pause on crypto-related tariffs temporarily eases pressure on U.S. Bitcoin mining firms, experts say the reprieve may spark a short-term rush in mining rig imports — but underlying challenges remain.Miners Eye Short-Term Advantage Before Tariff ResumptionPresident Donald Trump’s surprise decision to pause reciprocal tariff hikes until July 8, 2025, gives U.S.-based Bitcoin miners a narrow window to secure discounted hardware. However, a baseline 10% tariff still applies to most countries — excluding China, which now faces a 145% tariff rate on imports to the U.S.“We expect to see a short-term spike in machine imports as miners rush to get ahead of potential future tariff hikes,” said Hashlabs CEO Jaran Mellerud in a statement to Cointelegraph.The move follows the April 2 announcement of heightened tariffs on mining rig-exporting countries like Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%), and Malaysia (24%), which collectively host some of the world’s top mining rig manufacturers.Crypto Mining Rig Prices Already Surging in the USAccording to Luxor Technology COO Ethan Vera, mining machine prices have already jumped in the U.S. due to the uncertainty:“U.S. miners are still looking to purchase machines ahead of the potential further increase in 90 days. In addition, U.S.-landed machines have run up in price, as have contracts with onshore assembly.”With the global hashrate continuing to climb and mining difficulty reaching new highs, the cost of delaying hardware upgrades could hinder competitiveness — especially as overseas miners are spared the same tariff burdens.Policy Whiplash Threatens Long-Term Bitcoin Mining Viability in the USDespite the temporary relief, Mellerud argues that U.S. miners still face a “clear disadvantage” versus international competitors, citing higher capital expenditure and uncertainty that hinders strategic planning.“What miners need is predictability and stable rules — not policy whiplash every few months,” he said.Vera echoed this concern, revealing that Luxor is reevaluating its expansion strategy and may prioritize international markets due to the instability of U.S. policy.Trump’s Bitcoin Vision Faces Tariff ContradictionsIronically, Trump recently stated he wanted all remaining Bitcoin to be mined in the USA, and his family has backed a major mining initiative called “American Bitcoin,” led by Hut 8. The venture aims to build the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firm with U.S.-based reserves.But as Vera noted:“The crypto mining industry simply isn’t a high priority for the Trump administration — we’re collateral in a much broader trade war.”Bitcoin Price and Market ImpactBitcoin (BTC) is down 1.2% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $80,555, according to CoinGecko.BTC is now 26% off its all-time high of $108,786, recorded on January 20, 2025, the same day Trump returned to the White House, according to Cointelegraph.",04-11-2025

Binance,"Tech App Founder Charged with Fraud Over AI Claims
According to Cointelegraph, U.S. authorities have charged Albert Saniger, the founder and former CEO of the tech company Nate, with securities fraud and wire fraud. The charges stem from allegations that his e-commerce app, marketed as powered by artificial intelligence, actually relied on human workers based in the Philippines. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the charges on April 9, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a parallel civil action. Saniger, who founded Nate in 2018 and launched the app in July 2020, promoted it as an AI-driven universal shopping cart capable of completing online retail transactions without human intervention. However, the Justice Department claims that the app's operations were largely manual, with hundreds of contractors in the Philippines completing purchases. Acting U.S. Attorney for New York, Matthew Podolsky, accused Saniger of misleading investors by exploiting the appeal of AI technology to create a false narrative of innovation. Under this pretense, Saniger allegedly secured over $40 million in investments from venture capital firms, instructing employees to conceal the true nature of the app's automation. The Justice Department further alleged that Nate acquired AI technology from a third party and employed data scientists to develop it, but the app never achieved the capability to autonomously complete e-commerce transactions. During a busy holiday season in 2021, Saniger reportedly directed Nate's engineering team to develop bots to automate some transactions alongside human workers. Nate ceased operations in January 2023, and Saniger terminated all employees following media scrutiny of the app's capabilities, as noted in the SEC's court filing. The charges of securities and wire fraud each carry a potential maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The SEC's civil suit seeks to bar Saniger from holding office in any similar company and demands the return of investor funds.

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Faces $84K Resistance Wall, Could Soar to $96K if Momentum Builds, according to CryptoQuant Analysts
Bitcoin (BTC) may be facing a critical test around the $84,000 resistance level, according to a new market analysis by CryptoQuant. While bulls have regained control after a sharp pullback earlier in April, whether BTC can sustain its upward momentum will determine if the next leg toward $96,000 is possible — or if the cryptocurrency will remain range-bound in the low $80,000s.Bitcoin Bulls Eye $96K — But $84K is a Key HurdleIn an April 10 market report, CryptoQuant analysts noted that Bitcoin's previous support zones during this bull cycle have now flipped into potential resistance, citing $84,000 as the next key level to break.“These price levels have acted as price support during this bull cycle but can now act as price resistance if bullish conditions don’t continue to improve,” the report said.If Bitcoin manages to break above $84,000, analysts say the next target could be $96,000, especially if macroeconomic conditions support a broader market rally.BTC Price Rebounds After Trump’s 90-Day Tariff PauseBitcoin was trading at $79,474 at press time, down around 3.5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. The crypto market saw a sharp decline earlier in the month due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff announcements but rebounded sharply after he paused global tariffs for 90 days, excluding China.On April 1, Bitcoin spiked to over $85,000 before slumping to $76,000 by April 8 amid growing macroeconomic uncertainty.Following Trump’s announcement on April 9, BTC surged 9%, briefly retesting $83,000, and U.S. equity markets followed suit with record gains.The S&P 500 rose 9.52% — its third-largest one-day gain since World War II — while the Nasdaq 100 soared 12.02%.Experts Forecast Bitcoin Surge to $130K by JuneAbra Global CEO Bill Barhydt said in an April 10 X post that Bitcoin could soon climb above its previous all-time high of $109,000, predicting a price between $130,000 and $140,000 by late June.“Bitcoin is a levered bet on tech stocks, and all of it is going up and to the right,” Barhydt wrote, citing the global increase in money supply as a key driver.Similarly, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts recently told Cointelegraph that the market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could hit new highs before Q2 ends.CryptoQuant Bull Score Index Suggests CautionDespite renewed bullish sentiment, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index suggests the market is still in a relatively weak bull phase — the least bullish since November 2022.Only 1 out of 10 key bull signals tracked by the index is currently active — Bitcoin’s trading position above its 365-day moving average. Analysts say traders should closely watch for more signals to re-activate following the recent tariff pause. according to Cointelegraph.Key Levels to WatchImmediate resistance: $84,000Next major resistance: $96,000Support range: $76,000 – $79,000Potential upside (midterm): $130,000 – $140,000 (if macro tailwinds persist)",04-11-2025

The governance token, SuperRARE ($RARE), empowers holders to participate in the platform's decision-making processes. On April 3rd, SuperRare unveiled its own art gallery in New York City, resulting in a 40% surge in the value of its governance token, $RARE, reflecting strong investor enthusiasm for the initiative. Usual ($USUAL) is a decentralized issuer of fiat stablecoins, aiming to transform access to Real-World Assets (RWAs) within the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors. By utilizing blockchain technology, Usual develops financial products that emphasize transparency, decentralization, and fair value distribution.MANTRA ($OM) is a blockchain ecosystem that seeks to connect traditional finance with decentralized technology. It specializes in the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWAs), allowing users to digitize, trade, and manage both physical and financial assets securely, efficiently, and in compliance with regulations. MANTRA Chain has recently announced the establishment of the MANTRA Ecosystem Fund (MEF), a $108.8 million investment initiative aimed at fostering the growth and adoption of projects within the MANTRA ecosystem.The RWA sector has recently seen increased activity, with our desk observing strong flows in projects like $USUAL and $OM.Overall MarketSource: TradingViewThe above chart is the BTC price in the daily candle chart at the log scale.Last week, our analysis took a pessimistic view for the short term, anticipating a transition to a more optimistic perspective if the Federal Reserve decides to lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. This forecast is consistent with past actions taken by the Fed in response to weakening economic signals, including easing inflation or slowing growth, trends that recent data has started to indicate.The escalation of the trade conflict between the US and China, marked by increased import tariffs, led to a significant drop in global risk assets. On Monday, the S&P 500 index fell to an intraday low of 4,835, representing a 21.35% decline from its peak of 6,147 reached on February 19. This downturn had a ripple effect on international equity markets, resulting in substantial sell-offs in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The cryptocurrency market also reflected this negative trend, with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping to a low of $74,500 and Ethereum (ETH) falling to $1,411, highlighting a widespread risk-averse attitude.As we pointed out in our commentary on March 13, risk assets often tend to decline before the implementation of tariffs, followed by brief recoveries shortly after. However, these temporary rallies have consistently failed to reverse the overall downward trajectory. This pattern was evident again on April 9, when new US tariffs on imports came into effect, and the market initially opened with a slight increase, in line with historical trends.During the session, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all nations except China. This news triggered a rapid and significant shift in market sentiment towards a more optimistic outlook. The S&P 500 finished the day with a 9.5% increase, while Bitcoin surged over 9% to an intraday high of $83,400, driven by a notable short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when a rapid increase in the price of a heavily shorted asset forces short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, further driving up the price. This incident underscores the market's responsiveness to geopolitical developments.This trend mirrors a previous short squeeze on March 2, when President Trump announced intentions to add several altcoins to the US strategic crypto reserve. This news led to a 9% surge in Bitcoin, pushing its price to $95,000, although these gains were completely reversed after 24 hours. Such instances highlight the capacity of high-profile political actions to temporarily disrupt market dynamics. However, over extended timeframes, markets tend to revert to levels dictated by underlying fundamentals, tempering short-term enthusiasm.As the ongoing tariff conflict is primarily between the US and China, our desk is closely monitoring the situation and providing timely analysis of its effects on the cryptocurrency market. We have taken a neutral position on Bitcoin, as its price has stabilized within our previously established support range of $73,000 to $76,000. This zone is technically robust, underpinned by key moving averages and historical consolidation levels, suggesting resilient buying interest. While BTC may test this support in the near term, we anticipate it will hold as a critical floor.At the same time, our desk is carefully observing the US 10-year Treasury yield and any potential liquidity-boosting actions from the Federal Reserve. A drop in yields or signs of upcoming rate cuts could serve as a catalyst for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If the Fed indicates an early rate cut or implements quantitative easing, we see this as a possible inflection point that could trigger a significant rebound in both traditional risk assets and the cryptocurrency market.Macro at a glance Last Thursday (25-04-03)US initial jobless claims were reported at 219,000, which is below the anticipated figure of 225,000. This indicates that the US labour market remains strong, as evidenced by the low number of new unemployment claims. However, continuing jobless claims reached 1,903,000 last week, surpassing the expected 1,860,000. This trend suggests that while companies are not laying off employees, they may be implementing hiring freezes. Should economic conditions deteriorate due to tariffs, the market anticipates an increase in layoffs and a rapid decline in labour market conditions.The S&P Global Services PMI was recorded at 54.4 in March, slightly above the forecast of 54.3. Conversely, the ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 50.8, falling short of the predicted 53.0. Given that the ISM non-manufacturing PMI covers a broader range of industries, it reflects a cautiously optimistic outlook among purchasing managers regarding the future business climate.Last Friday (25-04-04)In March, the US nonfarm payrolls rose by 228,000 jobs, greatly exceeding the expected total of 137,000. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.3% for the month, which matched market predictions. At the same time, the unemployment rate saw a minor uptick, moving from 4.1% in February to 4.2% in March. Given the favourable state of the US labour market, analysts expect that the Federal Reserve will hold off on rate cuts until June.On Wednesday (25-04-09)The Reserve Bank of India has reduced its interest rate from 6.25% to 6.00%, aligning with market expectations. Effective midnight local time on April 9, the United States will implement tariffs on all its trading partners. In response, China imposed retaliatory tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods after President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese products to over 100%.During the trading session, President Trump announced that he set new tariff rates for imports from most U.S. trading partners at 10% for a period of 90 days to facilitate trade negotiations while imposing a 125% tariff on Chinese goods. Following this announcement, market sentiment shifted dramatically, with the S&P 500 index rising by 9.52% and the NASDAQ index increasing by 12.16%. Bitcoin's price surged past $83,000, marking a 9% increase, while MicroStrategy's stock price jumped by 24.7%.Convert Portal Volume Change﻿The above table shows the volume change on our Convert Portal by zone. Last week, the Real World Assets (RWA) sector emerged as a key player in driving growth in trading volume on the Convert platform. Our team also observed significant trading activity in the Liquid Staking and Monitoring sectors, indicating a healthy interest in these areas. Even though the market sentiment was bearish over the weekend, several altcoins managed to perform remarkably well, which in turn stimulated strong trading demand within the sector. This resilience highlights the dynamic nature of the market and the potential for growth even in challenging conditions.In the RWA sector, robust demand for trading led to a 41.0% increase in trading volume, primarily driven by heightened interest in Usual ($USUAL) and MANTRA ($OM).In the Liquid Staking sector, trading volume rose by 37.3% last week, largely propelled by strong market demand on Binance Staked SOL ($BNSOL).Why trade OTC?

Binance,"New York Attorney General Advocates for Federal Crypto Regulations
According to Cointelegraph, New York Attorney General Letitia James has urged U.S. congressional leaders to implement comprehensive federal regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. In a letter dated April 10, James emphasized the need for legislation to protect investors, enhance financial market stability, and prevent fraudulent activities. She outlined six significant risks associated with the lack of regulation, including the potential undermining of the U.S. dollar's dominance and national security threats due to criminal activities.James expressed concerns that the unregulated proliferation of digital assets could lead to price manipulation and rigged markets, facilitating fraud that drains billions from American investors and extracts assets from the economy. She recommended that Congress enact laws requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain a U.S. presence and regulatory oversight, ensuring stablecoins are backed by U.S. dollars or treasuries. Additionally, she advocated for regulations mandating platforms to collaborate only with entities compliant with anti-money laundering standards, establish registration requirements for issuers and intermediaries, protect against conflicts of interest, promote price transparency, and enforce fraud prevention measures.The Attorney General also voiced her opposition to the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in pension funds, citing their high volatility and lack of intrinsic value. She argued that digital assets are unsuitable for retirement savings and warned against investing in crypto-tracking exchange-traded funds, which she claimed are vulnerable to permanent theft. James urged Congress to consider the risks posed by the cryptocurrency industry to national security, financial stability, and American citizens as it drafts legislation governing the sector.This call for regulation comes in the wake of the U.S. Department of Justice's reported dismantling of its federal criminal cryptocurrency fraud enforcement division. James's appeal highlights the ongoing debate over the need for regulatory oversight in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.",04-11-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Chinese Yuan Plunges to 18-Year Low Amid Trade War—Is a Bitcoin Bull Run Next?
Bitcoin could benefit from yuan weakness as Chinese capital seeks refuge in decentralized assets.The Chinese renminbi (CNY) has plummeted to its lowest level since 2007, becoming a central flashpoint in the escalating trade war between the United States and China. The move has reignited speculation that a weakening yuan could once again serve as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC), as investors brace for tighter capital controls and seek alternative stores of value.Yuan Hits Rmb7.351 — PBoC Signals Controlled DepreciationAccording to data from TradingView, the onshore yuan touched Rmb7.351 per USD before modestly recovering. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has allowed a weaker “fixing” rate for six consecutive sessions, signaling an official shift toward currency depreciation. The last time the yuan saw such pressure was during the global financial crisis.“The PBoC appears to be allowing a modest decline to cushion exporters from the impact of U.S. tariffs,” analysts noted, pointing to last week’s sweeping tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.While U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned against further CNY devaluation—calling it “a tax on the rest of the world”—China has thus far avoided any shock moves, aiming instead for a “controlled pace of depreciation,” according to a Chinese state bank trader.US-China Trade War EscalatesTensions rose sharply after Trump unveiled a 125% tariff on Chinese imports while temporarily pausing tariffs for other nations at 10%. In response, China slapped an 84% tariff on American goods, intensifying fears of a global economic slowdown and triggering speculation about competitive currency devaluations worldwide.The offshore yuan (CNH), which trades more freely, hit a record low of Rmb7.42 this week. Meanwhile, capital outflows appear to be accelerating, with the Hong Kong dollar hitting its strongest level against the USD since 2021.Historical Trends Suggest Bitcoin Could BenefitHistorically, periods of CNY weakness have coincided with surging Bitcoin interest among Chinese investors. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, pointed out that during similar macro conditions in 2013 and 2015, Bitcoin experienced explosive growth as a hedge against yuan depreciation.“CNY deval = narrative that Chinese capital flight will flow into $BTC,” Hayes said on X.In 2017, when China imposed tighter capital controls and banned local crypto exchanges, Bitcoin demand surged domestically. Chinese exchanges like Huobi and OKX once accounted for over 90% of global BTC trading volumes.“The Chinese really look to Bitcoin as an excellent digital store of value — a new electronic version of gold,” said Bobby Lee, founder of BTC China.With China still enforcing strict capital controls, limiting overseas fund transfers to $50,000 annually, Bitcoin continues to present itself as a decentralized alternative to preserve wealth.Analysts Eye Capital Flight and Bitcoin MomentumAs Beijing’s monetary policy shifts to buffer against tariffs, analysts are watching for spillover effects into crypto markets. A rising BTC/CNY narrative could re-emerge if Chinese investors seek refuge from inflation and policy uncertainty.Chris Burniske, a prominent crypto investor, previously predicted that yuan weakness would drive BTC higher—a pattern that played out during past trade shocks.With BTC trading above $82,000 and up nearly 9% in 24 hours following Trump’s temporary tariff pause, analysts warn that another yuan-led Bitcoin rally could be forming.Key TakeawaysThe yuan hit Rmb7.351, its lowest level since 2007.Trade war escalates, with the U.S. imposing 125% tariffs on China and Beijing retaliating.Past yuan devaluations have triggered Bitcoin surges as Chinese investors seek financial hedges.Capital flight and strict controls could reinforce Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized store of value.",04-11-2025
Binance,"BROCCOLI Project Interview: Inside the Meme Coin Winner of Binance Vote List Without VCs or Hype
In a crypto world saturated with overhyped tokens and influencer-backed pump-and-dumps, BROCCOLI Project stands out as a true anomaly. What began as a meme sparked by CZ’s tweet about his dog has blossomed into a powerful movement—fueled not by VCs or celebrity endorsements but by the unwavering support of its community.Following its triumph in Binance’s listing vote, BROCCOLI has become the face of the new meme coin wave on BNB Chain. In this exclusive interview, we sat down with key contributors from the Broccoli team to explore the philosophy behind the project, the power of decentralisation, and what lies ahead in this vibrant green revolution.Origins & VisionHow did the Broccoli meme coin begin? Was it always the plan to turn CZ’s dog post into a crypto movement?It was neither planned nor known that CZ would be sharing his dog, Broccoli or that it would be turned into a meme coin. Until CZ shared it. After CZ made that post, the Broccoli token was launched on Four.Meme with a contract address that ends with “714”. After the creators (dev) sold all their tokens, the actual holders came together to build the Broccoli community. This project is completely community-based and the aim is to do charity works for “dog”s, which is also the theme of the project. This growing community started to attract the attention of CZ, many exchanges like Binance and the whole cryptocurrency world. This is how Broccoli's story began.A lot of meme coins rely on celebrity hype or VC backing. Why did Broccoli choose to stay 100% community-driven—and how did you make that work?Meme coin projects that are not community-driven centered around one person or group and do not have a goal can become futureless. In our project, there are goals and a community that is built around the project. It was the community itself that helped us succeed in building the community. The Broccoli community, which was small at first, believed in the project and supported it all the way. Now it is much bigger and much stronger. And it is determined to be even bigger and stronger in the future. Because the community doesn't disappear, it continues to grow.Why the name “Broccoli”? Was the symbolic link between broccoli, CZ’s story, and “blockchain” a deliberate branding strategy or an organic coincidence?Broccoli, as you know, comes from Broccoli, CZ's dog. So, it is directly related. There is also a sweet symbolic connection with the term “blockchain”, which, coincidentally, Broccoli always aims to build, just like blockchain.Security, Technology & TrustBroccoli has no dev access, no buy/sell tax, and a renounced contract. How important were these elements in building early trust with your community?Having no dev access and no buy/sell tax on Broccoli has helped buyers understand that this is truly a community project, and renouncing the contract has made it easier to build and protect the trust in the project. So, we can say that elements like these helped us succeed because they are often the first thing investors look at.How does the four.meme launchpad ensures liquidity security, and how has that helped protect holders from rug pulls or honeypots?Four.Meme transfers the liquidity to PancakeSwap after the completion of the bonding curve, which creates the pool and allows investors to use it safely. This clearly proves that the project is not a rug pull or a honeypot.Can you talk about the audit process and how the smart contract verification helped solidify your credibility in a meme coin space often plagued by scams?Since our project has passed all security audits (which can be tracked through many platforms), the level of credibility has always remained high. Because if the project is secure and this information is verifiable, it means that the investor's transactions are safe. This increases investor confidence in the project.Community & DecentralizationYour holders stood firm even during copycat attacks and insider manipulation. What do you think keeps the Broccoli community so resilient and united?We had copycat attacks on our Broccoli project from inside and outside, but our community leaders, who are always on duty and always in contact with our holders, immediately solved such problems. So, it is the community itself that keeps the community resilient and united.What role does the community play in governance, roadmap decisions, and meme propagation?Even though we are working non-stop for the good and continuity of the project, we always discuss this with our community before every decision we make, and we always consider their opinions. Because everyone is a community member. So, it is the community that manages the project. For our roadmap, we discuss the things we want to do as a community before determining the charity works we will do or when we want to bring innovations to our project. Also, memes are created and shared by the community, including the project's social media accounts. Our creators share the arts in the meme group we have.How do you empower your global community to spread Broccoli culture beyond crypto Twitter? Is there any plans for real-world engagement or branding?As a real-world engagement, we have charity work, which is also a mission of our project. Our community members come together and support a dog shelter in need with dog foods and, if needed, medicines for sick dogs etc. The costs are funded by a multi-signature wallet supported by the community. We have already made many donations and you can find them and many more things we are planning on our Twitter account.Market Performance & Binance ListingWith over $1B in trading volume and more than 39,000 holders, what were the most critical turning points in Broccoli’s growth story?Broccoli has been a winner from the beginning, and while every day has been full of successes, the critical points were the day Binance announced that Broccoli had joined Binance's Vote to List event and the day it was announced that Broccoli had won.What does winning the Binance vote mean for the project? How do you plan to use this listing to fuel long-term value instead of short-term hype?Binance's listing of our token proved once again that we are the first and only one, and we are a successful winning project. We will continue this for the long term with more listings, more charity works and more innovations.Are there any behind-the-scenes moments from the Binance vote campaign you’d love to share with your community?We were very determined that even if we didn't succeed in the Vote to List campaign, we would still keep building. But we were also very sure that we deserved to be the winner, so we weren't worried about that,  just kept building.Utility, Ecosystem & Future PlansBroccoli is meme-first, but is there any plan to build out a broader ecosystem—NFTs, GameFi, or DeFi integrations?Our project is already related to DeFi indirectly because of its charity work. Our plans are to strengthen these relations. Apart from DeFi, we have plans in many other areas, especially NFT. Our goal is to combine charity with blockchain and an automated system (artificial intelligence).We have heard rumours about upcoming utility. Is Broccoli exploring partnerships, utility tokens, or staking mechanisms?Broccoli is still exploring partnership issues. We will consider and discuss these as a community.In a volatile meme coin space, what’s your long-term vision for Broccoli five years from now?Broccoli’s future plans include getting more listings, donating more to dog shelters, reaching out to more countries, and building our community and system. Industry Trends & PhilosophyMeme coins like DOGE and SHIB had their moment. What do you think makes Broccoli different—and how are you avoiding their pitfalls?Broccoli token is and will always be standing strong. What makes it different and strong is its hardworking and solid community - and its mission. We will continue to build, as we always do. We will work harder. And this will lead us to be more successful.What do you think this rise of Broccoli says about the power of community-led finance in Web3?Broccoli's amazing rise to success is a great example of how strong a real community can be. The Broccoli community achieved all this together and we will always continue to do so.Do you believe the success of Broccoli could trigger a new wave of “decentralized meme IPOs” with zero VC control?Broccoli is a successful and strong project, based on the community, so it can be seen as a model for many projects in the future. This could be a new beginning.Community Rapid Fire (Fun Segment):One word to describe Broccoli’s community?Building.What’s your favourite Broccoli meme so far?A meme that CZ and Broccoli are building together. ﻿﻿ If Broccoli had a motto for 2025, what would it be?“Love in Action.”",04-11-2025

According to BlockBeats, recent data from Coinglass indicates that Bitcoin's volatility has decreased for two consecutive days, currently standing at 2.54%.High volatility in Bitcoin is often associated with speculative trading and retail investor FOMO (fear of missing out). A decline in volatility may suggest a reduction in short-term speculative activity, signaling a market consolidation or 'cooling-off' period.

This Biden-era regulation required DeFi platforms, including decentralized exchanges, to disclose their gross proceeds from cryptocurrency sales and provide details about the parties involved in these transactions.The decision to reverse the rule was anticipated, as David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, indicated in March that President Trump would support the measure's repeal.

Binance,"North Carolina Proposes Digital Asset Freedom Act Amidst Anti-CBDC Legislation
According to Cointelegraph, North Carolina Representative Neal Jackson introduced the North Carolina Digital Asset Freedom Act on April 10, 2025. The proposed legislation aims to recognize qualifying digital assets as a legitimate form of payment, including for tax purposes. While the bill does not explicitly mention Bitcoin, it outlines criteria that align closely with Bitcoin's characteristics. These include a minimum market capitalization of $750 billion, a daily trading volume exceeding $10 billion, a market history of at least a decade, proven censorship resistance, a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, absence of a central authority, 99.98% or more network uptime, and a capped supply. The bill emphasizes that decentralized digital assets, free from central governance, adhere to economic principles of limited, noninflationary money, ensuring transaction security and integrity.This legislative move is part of a broader trend in the United States, where states are exploring Bitcoin strategic reserve legislation in response to inflation concerns, high federal debt, and currency depreciation. The introduction of the Digital Asset Freedom Act follows North Carolina's firm stance against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In July 2024, former Governor Roy Cooper vetoed a bill that sought to ban CBDCs, describing it as premature and reactionary. However, the North Carolina House of Representatives overrode this veto in August 2024 with a decisive 73-41 vote, followed by the Senate's 27-17 vote in September 2024, effectively enacting the anti-CBDC legislation.Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Blockchain Association, praised North Carolina lawmakers for their opposition to CBDCs. He criticized Governor Cooper's veto, suggesting it was a missed opportunity to convey a strong message to the Federal Reserve about the state's unified stance against CBDCs. Spuller's comments reflect a broader sentiment within the crypto advocacy community, which views state-level actions as crucial in shaping the future of digital currencies in the United States. As North Carolina continues to navigate the evolving landscape of digital assets and CBDCs, the outcomes of these legislative efforts could have significant implications for the state's economic and financial strategies.",04-10-2025

Binance,"Ether ETFs in the U.S. May Begin Staking by May, Analyst Predicts
According to Cointelegraph, Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States might soon be able to stake a portion of their tokens, potentially starting as early as May. This development follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) recent authorization for exchanges to list options contracts tied to spot Ether ETFs. This approval came after the SEC had previously greenlit Bitcoin ETF options in September. Despite this progress, issuers are still awaiting the regulator's permission to offer staking services for Ether ETFs, having submitted numerous requests earlier this year.The approval of options contracts is seen as a significant step toward regulatory acceptance of staking services in the U.S. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart indicated that while staking clearance for ETH funds could occur as early as May, it is more likely to be finalized by the end of 2025. Seyffart noted potential intermediate deadlines for approval or denial in late May and late August. Options are financial derivatives that provide investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price before a specific date. In contrast, staking involves locking up cryptocurrency, such as ETH, to support network operations like transaction validation, in exchange for rewards.Ether ETFs, which launched in June 2024, have struggled to gain significant investor interest. Data from Farside Investors shows that as of April 10, these funds have seen net inflows of $2.4 billion, compared to $35 billion for Bitcoin ETFs introduced in January. Analysts suggest that the SEC's approval of Ether ETF options could boost adoption. Asset managers are also awaiting the SEC's decision on requests to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for both Bitcoin and Ether ETFs.The emergence of options markets tied to spot crypto ETFs is considered a monumental advancement in crypto markets, creating compelling opportunities for investors, according to Jeff Park, Bitwise Invest’s head of alpha strategies. However, staking could represent the most significant advancement for Ether funds. In March, Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, remarked that Ether ETFs are less effective without staking, as staking yields are a crucial component of generating investment returns in this space.",04-10-2025

According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's journey from a peer-to-peer cash system to its current status as digital gold has sparked debate among both critics and supporters. Originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, Bitcoin was not intended to remain static. However, its functionality as a form of money remains a topic of discussion. In a recent episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson engaged with Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of StarkWare, who shared insights on Bitcoin's potential transformation.Ben-Sasson outlined a framework for Bitcoin's evolution, emphasizing the importance of scaling its foundational principles rather than abandoning them. He identified three core pillars essential for Bitcoin's widespread adoption: broadness, integrity, and verifiability. These technical targets, according to Ben-Sasson, are crucial for enhancing Bitcoin's usability. He highlighted the potential impact of reintroducing the opcode OP_CAT, which could make Bitcoin programmable once again with just ""nine lines of code.""Currently, Bitcoin is often perceived as a store of value, akin to digital gold. However, Ben-Sasson envisions a future where Bitcoin functions as a digital economy—permissionless, inclusive, and suitable for everyday transactions. This shift requires rethinking Bitcoin's purpose and upgrading its operational framework. ""If we don’t make Bitcoin more useful, we risk making it irrelevant,"" Ben-Sasson warned. The discussion also delved into the politics of Bitcoin governance and the role of zero-knowledge proofs and layer-2 solutions in creating scalable, decentralized systems.The conversation further explored the challenges of building a monetary system that serves everyone, not just the technically adept or financially privileged. Ben-Sasson emphasized the need for a system where any two parties can transact without a trusted intermediary, stating, ""We are not in a situation where Bitcoin is a system that today can allow any two parties to transact without any trusted intermediary. We're simply not there. To me, that's the start, middle and end of the reason why things need to change."" For those interested in the full discussion, the episode is available on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts, and Spotify.",04-10-2025

Binance,"U.S. March Consumer Prices Decline Amid Inflation Concerns
According to Odaily, consumer prices in the United States unexpectedly fell in March, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff reductions on other countries, which tend to increase inflation risks. The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% in March, following a 0.2% rise in February. This decline may reflect a drop in energy costs and the fading impact of price increases earlier in the year. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the core CPI rose by 0.1% in March, compared to a 0.2% increase in February. Year-over-year, the core CPI increased by 2.8% in March, down from a 3.1% rise in February. The March data likely reflects only a small portion of the initial wave of Trump's import tariffs. Capital Economics estimates that the inflation rate will peak at around 4%, double the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's March 18-19 meeting, released on Wednesday, indicate that policymakers almost unanimously agree that the economy faces the dual risks of rising inflation and slowing growth.",04-10-2025

Trade tensions might exert pressure on the demand for dollar reserves, creating opportunities for competitive assets such as other fiat currencies, gold, and Bitcoin.Historical precedents suggest that a weak dollar and above-average inflation could persist, potentially benefiting Bitcoin in such a macroeconomic environment.

According to Odaily, Wells Fargo economist Sarah House has commented on the upcoming March CPI data for the United States, suggesting it may appear somewhat delayed. However, it is expected to provide insights into how the evolving trade environment is beginning to impact prices. With tariffs accelerating price increases, March is likely to represent the low point for core inflation this year. Coupled with growing concerns over a self-induced economic recession in the U.S., this situation keeps the Federal Reserve in a 'wait-and-see' stance regarding interest rates. Although uncertainties remain about the duration of these tariffs, their transmission effects, and secondary price impacts, the trend is clear.

According to PANews, an analysis by OKG Research reveals that as of April 8, 2025, the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) balance has decreased from $405.786 billion at the beginning of the month to $309.989 billion. This reduction has released $95.79 billion in liquidity, a rate 3.18 times faster than the same period in March. This action is perceived by the market as a form of 'invisible fiscal easing,' providing short-term support for risk assets. On the blockchain front, since the beginning of 2024, the global stablecoin market has grown by 80.7%, surpassing $235 billion. Stablecoins are increasingly seen as simplified monetary tools within the shadow banking system, injecting liquidity into the crypto economy when issued. The resonance between fiscal liquidity release and the issuance pace of on-chain dollars offers additional liquidity support in a constrained liquidity environment, driving short-term risk appetite recovery. Notably, from a monetary policy perspective, if the Federal Reserve maintains its current stance, the pace and space of fiscal liquidity release, along with the on-chain issuance of crypto liquidity, will become significant variables in the next wave of asset price fluctuations.",04-10-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin News: Is This a New Crypto Bull Run or Just a Bear Market Rally? Analysts Warn of Potential Downside
Bitcoin and stock markets soar on Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, but experts say the rally could be short-lived.Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market rallied sharply this week, fueled by optimism after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on global trade tariffs. The S&P 500 surged nearly 10%, recording its biggest single-day gain since 2008, while Bitcoin briefly spiked above $82,000, driving excitement across crypto Twitter. But is this the start of a new bull run — or just a temporary bounce in a longer bear market trend?Historical Bear Market Patterns Suggest CautionWhile many investors celebrated the rebound, analysts from Goldman Sachs and other major firms are warning that bear market rallies are common — and often misleading. According to Goldman’s report titled ""Bear Market Anatomy"", there have been 19 bear market rallies since the 1980s, typically lasting 44 days with average returns of 10-15%, only to be followed by deeper declines.Callum Thomas, head of research at Topdown Charts, echoed the sentiment, noting that the 1930s bear market featured multiple double-digit rallies before bottoming out. ""Is the 90-day bounce a BMR [Bear Market Rally]?"" he asked.Bitcoin Rally Follows Similar PatternsAlthough Bitcoin price surged past $82K, analysts argue that this move mirrors past volatility during uncertain macroeconomic periods. With ongoing trade tensions, particularly against China, and no clear support from the Federal Reserve, the long-term bullish case remains unconfirmed.Historical data shows that crypto bull runs require more than temporary relief — they often coincide with structural changes like regulatory clarity, central bank easing, or extreme oversold conditions.What Investors Should Watch NextGoldman Sachs points out that for a sustained bull market to return, several conditions must be met:Attractive valuationsPolicy intervention or rate cutsA slowdown in macroeconomic deteriorationExtreme bearish positioningAt the time of writing, these signs are not clearly present. The tariff pause is temporary, inflation data remains volatile, and many equities and crypto assets are still trading at high valuations relative to fundamentals.Bullish or Bear Trap?While the recent market surge is encouraging, it may not signal the start of a new bull cycle. Instead, it could be one of several bear market rallies that create false confidence before further declines.Investors are advised to remain cautious, especially with upcoming macroeconomic events like the March CPI report, which could further influence both equity and crypto market direction, according to CoinDesk.",04-10-2025

Market participants are now keenly watching how the CPI data could impact risk sentiment and crypto valuations.“This shows a strong acceleration in BTC inflows to Binance. It’s likely that investors are actively moving funds due to macro uncertainty and before the CPI release,” Regterschot noted.Inflows: Bearish or Bullish?Traditionally, large BTC inflows to exchanges are interpreted as a sign of potential selling pressure, with traders preparing to exit positions during volatile events. However, Swyftx analyst Pav Hundal says that’s not always the case.“It is plausible that Binance is shifting assets into its hot wallets to meet heavy demand,” said Hundal. “The next few days are critical to understanding market appetite after Trump’s tariff climbdown.”Trump’s decision to maintain 125% tariffs on China while offering relief to other countries continues to drive a polarized macro backdrop. Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland predicted CPI will fall to around 2.5%, while others, including analyst Dyme, believe a lower-than-expected CPI reading will fuel another leg up in crypto prices.Still, FactSet consensus estimates expect a 0.1% month-over-month rise in consumer prices for March.

According to PANews, OpenSea has reached out to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to request clarification on the regulatory status of NFT platforms.

Binance,"Ukraine Proposes Taxation Framework for Crypto Transactions
According to Cointelegraph, Ukraine's National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) has introduced a proposal to tax certain cryptocurrency transactions as personal income, with rates reaching up to 23%. This proposal, unveiled on April 8, excludes crypto-to-crypto transactions and stablecoins from taxation. The framework suggests an 18% tax on crypto transactions, supplemented by a 5% military levy. NSSMC Chairman Ruslan Magomedov emphasized the urgency of addressing crypto taxes, stating that it is a pressing reality. The framework aims to assist lawmakers in making informed decisions by evaluating the pros and cons of each suggestion, as these factors could significantly impact the market and tax obligations.The proposed framework specifies that taxes will be levied when cryptocurrencies are converted into fiat currency or exchanged for goods and services. By excluding crypto-to-crypto transactions from taxation, Ukraine aligns itself with several European nations, such as Austria and France, and crypto-friendly regions like Singapore. The NSSMC also noted that it is logical to exclude stablecoins backed by foreign currencies from taxation or to apply a reduced tax rate of 5% or 9%, given that Ukraine's tax code already exempts income from transactions involving foreign exchange values. The report suggests that stablecoins backed by foreign currencies could be exempt from taxation.The framework also addresses other crypto-related activities, including mining, staking, hard forks, and airdrops, proposing various taxation options. While crypto mining is generally viewed as a business activity, the framework suggests a potential tax-free limit for specific crypto transactions, including mining. Staking might be classified as ""business captive income"" or taxed only when converted to fiat currencies. Hard forks and airdrops could be taxed as ordinary income or upon cashing out the tokens. The NSSMC proposes a tax-free threshold to alleviate the burden on small investors, a practice common in other jurisdictions. Exemptions for donations, transfers between family members, and long-term crypto holders are also considered, though non-custodial crypto wallets might not qualify for these exemptions.In December, Daniil Getmantsev, head of Ukraine's parliamentary tax committee, mentioned that a draft bill to legalize cryptocurrencies was under review and anticipated to be finalized early this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously signed a law in March 2022, establishing a legal framework for a regulated crypto market in the country.",04-10-2025

According to Cointelegraph, the rigidity of United States securities laws poses challenges for digital asset companies, as highlighted during a House Committee hearing on April 9. Rodrigo Seira, special counsel to Cooley LLP, emphasized the difficulties faced by crypto-native companies in aligning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The hearing, titled 'American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: Aligning the U.S. Securities Laws for the Digital Age,' featured insights from Seira, WilmerHale partner Tiffany J. Smith, Polygon chief legal officer Jake Werrett, and Alexandra Thorn, a senior director at the Center for American Progress.Seira pointed out that the current securities regulatory framework is inadequate for regulating cryptocurrencies, failing to meet its policy objectives. He argued that the notion of crypto projects registering with the SEC is misleading, as evidenced by the lack of successful registrations. Despite acknowledging that crypto promoters raising capital should adhere to federal securities laws, Seira noted that few projects have managed to register their tokens under these laws without facing regulatory uncertainty. He explained that registration is not a straightforward process, as it requires operating as a publicly reporting company, similar to stock registration.Representative Bryan Steil, leading the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, addressed the hearing, recognizing the regulatory hurdles established by the previous administration. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, lawmakers are working to rectify these issues by introducing sensible legislation. The House Financial Services Committee recently advanced the STABLE Act, aimed at regulating payment stablecoins linked to the US dollar and other fiat currencies. Additionally, the Senate Banking Committee progressed the GENIUS Act, which seeks to regulate stablecoin issuers by setting reserve requirements and enforcing Anti-Money Laundering compliance.Steil highlighted the next phase of legislative efforts, focusing on comprehensive digital asset market structure legislation.

According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin has demonstrated notable resilience in the face of geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, particularly following recent tariff announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump. Blockstream CEO Adam Back highlighted Bitcoin's performance during these turbulent times, noting its potential to diverge from traditional risk-on assets like stocks in the long term.Back, a prominent figure in Bitcoin's early development and one of the original cypherpunks, shared his insights during an interview at Paris Blockchain Week. He emphasized Bitcoin's significant growth, stating that it has increased five or six times since the market bottom three years ago. This growth, he argues, indicates a decoupling from other financial markets. Back predicts that Bitcoin will benefit from factors such as regulatory clarity, institutional interest, and the legitimizing impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He observed that while many long-term holders are fully invested and unable to capitalize on market dips, major entities like BlackRock and sovereign wealth funds are quietly acquiring Bitcoin, absorbing available supply.Back also explored the geopolitical implications of Bitcoin, suggesting that governments might start acquiring the cryptocurrency actively. He speculated that if the U.S. government does not initiate a significant buying spree, acquiring 1 million Bitcoin over the next five years, it could allow new market entrants to establish substantial positions through brokers and ETFs.

According to PANews, Moody's has issued a report highlighting significant risks associated with the burgeoning tokenization of funds. Cristiano Ventricelli, Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst, emphasized the importance of investors weighing the benefits of tokenized funds against risks related to underlying technology, security, scalability, and regulatory changes. Moody's noted that many fund managers lack experience in the early stages of the tokenization market, often operating with small teams and short track records. This creates a key person risk, where over-reliance on a few individuals could destabilize funds if key executives leave or governance structures are weak. The agency urged fund teams to diversify responsibilities and enhance risk management. Blockchain disruptions pose another risk due to the novelty of the technology. While smart contracts can improve operational efficiency, they are vulnerable to coding defects or malicious attacks. Using public, permissionless blockchains increases accessibility but also heightens potential attack risks. Moody's recommends maintaining off-chain backups and conducting thorough audits of smart contracts. Redemption mechanisms are identified as a weak point. Moody's encourages tokenized funds to allow redemptions in both stablecoins and fiat currency to mitigate impacts from stablecoin de-pegging or blockchain disruptions. Additionally, operating across different jurisdictions presents varied regulatory challenges, increasing legal obstacles for investor claims. Some funds offer structures granting token holders direct claims to underlying assets, but enforceability depends on local laws and the completeness of fund documentation.",04-09-2025

Binance,"Tokenized Real-World Assets Projected to Reach $30 Trillion by 2034, Experts Debate Feasibility
According to Cointelegraph, the potential for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to surpass $30 trillion by the 2030s is a topic of debate among industry leaders. In June 2024, Standard Chartered Bank and Synpulse forecasted that RWAs could exceed $30 trillion by 2034, a sentiment echoed by several analysts throughout the year. However, skepticism remains regarding the accuracy of these projections. At the Paris Blockchain Week 2025, a panel discussion moderated by Cointelegraph’s managing editor, Gareth Jenkinson, featured key figures from the tokenization ecosystem, including Charles Adkins of Hedera, Dotun Rominiyi from the London Stock Exchange, Shy Datika of INX, Steven Gaertner of Tiamonds, and Securitize chief operating officer Michael Sonnenshein. While most panelists supported the ambitious $30 trillion estimate, Sonnenshein expressed doubts, citing existing systems that effectively manage traditional assets. Sonnenshein, formerly the CEO of Grayscale Investments, argued that tokenized assets might not achieve the projected $30 trillion valuation. He emphasized that while tokenization offers potential benefits, it is not always necessary for assets that already have efficient trading systems. Despite his conservative outlook, Sonnenshein remains optimistic about the future of RWAs, suggesting that tokenization will continue to attract investors who view their digital wallets as comprehensive investment platforms akin to traditional brokerage accounts. The discussion also touched on the application of tokenization in real estate, a sector where Sonnenshein voiced skepticism. In the United Arab Emirates, efforts to integrate tokenization with real estate have gained traction, exemplified by a $1 billion agreement between local developer Damac and RWA blockchain Mantra to tokenize real estate assets. Despite these developments, Sonnenshein questioned the suitability of real estate as a primary focus for tokenization, arguing that while blockchain technology can enhance efficiency by reducing intermediaries, the current on-chain economy favors more liquid assets. Sonnenshein acknowledged the potential advantages of tokenizing real estate, such as streamlining processes and eliminating middlemen, but maintained that these benefits do not necessarily translate into effective ownership representation. He concluded that the demand within the blockchain economy is currently oriented towards assets that offer greater liquidity, rather than those tied to real estate.",04-09-2025

According to Odaily, Natasha Cazenave, Executive Director of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), addressed the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on April 8. She highlighted that as the cryptocurrency industry expands and its ties with traditional financial institutions deepen, a significant drop in crypto prices could trigger a chain reaction affecting the entire financial system. Currently, crypto assets account for only 1% of global financial assets and do not pose a major 'spillover effect.' However, the rapid growth of the sector, particularly in the crypto-friendly U.S. market, is notable. The European Union has implemented the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) to mitigate risks, but Cazenave emphasized that there are 'no absolutely safe crypto assets,' suggesting that additional regulations might be necessary to reduce future risks. Presently, about 10%-20% of European investors hold crypto assets, while 95% of European banks have yet to engage in this area.",04-09-2025
Binance,"Ethereum's Performance Against Bitcoin: A Decade of Challenges
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum has struggled to outperform Bitcoin since its inception nearly a decade ago. Analysts reveal that Ether (ETH) has only surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) in performance for 15% of all trading days since it began trading in mid-2015. Analyst James Check highlighted this trend in an April 8 post on X, noting that Ether significantly outperformed Bitcoin during its early years from mid-2015 to mid-2017. There were also brief periods in late 2019 and early 2020 when the ETH to BTC ratio favored Ether. However, over the past five years, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed Ether. The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether's price in terms of Bitcoin, reached a five-year low of 0.018 on April 9, as reported by TradingView. The last time the ratio fell below this level was in December 2019, when ETH dropped to $125 while Bitcoin was trading at approximately $7,000. Recently, Ether has erased seven years of gains, plunging an additional 10% over the past 24 hours to below $1,450, which is beneath its 2018 market cycle peak. On April 9, ETH fell to $1,400 in early trading, according to CoinGecko. In comparison, Bitcoin experienced a 6% decline, falling to $75,000, which remains 275% higher than its peak during the bull market seven years ago. Concerns have been raised by Ethereum supporters regarding the network's growth, as the token struggled to gain momentum earlier this year despite Bitcoin reaching a new price peak. Web3 researcher Stacy Muur expressed these concerns in an April 8 post on X, stating, ""I love Ethereum. However, it’s time to face reality: Ethereum has had [around] the same number of active addresses for the past 4 years."" Nonetheless, other researchers have pointed out that most new addresses are on Ethereum layer-2 scaling networks, which have seen a significant increase in value locked onchain over the past couple of years, according to L2beat. While many long-term ETH investors are currently holding at a loss, technical indicators such as fractal patterns observed in 2018 and 2022 suggest that the asset may be nearing oversold levels, with a potential bottom around the $1,000 mark, according to Cointelegraph analysis. This analysis indicates that Ethereum could be approaching a turning point, despite the challenges it has faced in outperforming Bitcoin over the years.",04-09-2025

Binance,"FDIC Develops Transparent Framework for U.S. Banks Engaging in Crypto Activities
According to PANews, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is working on a more transparent framework for U.S. banks involved in crypto asset activities, including the use of public, permissionless blockchains. On April 8, FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill addressed the American Bankers Association Summit in Washington, outlining the agency's evolving stance on crypto-related activities. A key area under review involves the interaction between regulated banks and public, permissionless blockchains. Hill acknowledged that while jurisdictions outside the U.S. have permitted banks to use public blockchains for years, U.S. regulators have been more cautious. The FDIC now considers a blanket ban on public blockchain usage too restrictive, though Hill emphasized the need for appropriate safeguards to regulate such activities. The agency is assessing existing interagency guidance, including joint statements from January and February 2023, to establish enduring standards for the responsible use of public networks. The possibility of operating public blockchains in a permissioned mode is also under consideration. Hill noted that regulators must evaluate how to define and regulate blockchain configurations that blur the lines between open and permissioned environments. The FDIC plans to issue further guidance on specific digital asset use cases. Hill stated that the agency will continue to assess unresolved issues related to the scope of crypto-related activities, regulatory treatment of blockchain-based products, and risk management expectations for banks operating in this field. The broader goal is to create a consistent and transparent regulatory framework that promotes innovation while ensuring compliance with safety and soundness standards. Hill recently highlighted that the revised guidance represents a fundamental shift in the U.S. banking system's approach to crypto assets and blockchain technology. He emphasized that the FDIC has rescinded previous requirements for regulated institutions to notify the agency before engaging in digital asset and blockchain activities. Hill also addressed emerging issues surrounding stablecoins, particularly legislative developments in Congress. The FDIC is reviewing potential updates to pass-through deposit insurance regulations to clarify eligibility requirements for stablecoin reserve deposits. Key issues under evaluation include liquidity risk management, safeguards against illicit finance, and cybersecurity standards. The FDIC is considering whether to further clarify the boundaries of permissible activities in this area or expand regulatory guidance to cover more use cases. Hill stressed the need for clearer regulatory treatment of tokenized real-world assets and liabilities, including tokenized commercial bank deposits. He expressed concern about whether counterparties could use smart contracts to withdraw funds at face value after a bank failure, potentially increasing liquidation costs. These concerns are driving internal FDIC efforts to evaluate technical solutions to prevent unexpected fund outflows in bank resolution scenarios. Hill noted the challenge of aligning on-chain programmability with traditional regulatory safeguards designed to ensure the orderly liquidation of failed institutions. These changes mark the FDIC's formal move towards providing regulatory clarity for banks exploring digital asset infrastructure, while emphasizing the need for cautious risk controls and further clarification of permissible activities.",04-09-2025

In his address, Buterin explored the potential outcomes of further expanding Ethereum's Layer 1 (L1) network. Buterin suggested that the same technologies used to scale Layer 2 (L2) solutions could eventually be applied to L1. He explained that L2 solutions leverage the asymmetry between production and verification, a concept that could also be utilized by L1. In such a scenario, Buterin outlined the roles L2 would play, including handling ultra-large scale operations that surpass the capabilities of native data availability (DA), improving transaction ordering with lower latency and protection against maximal extractable value (MEV), and implementing diverse virtual machine (VM) designs.

Binance,"Cybersecurity Alert: Malware Targets Crypto Wallets via Fake Microsoft Office Extensions
According to Cointelegraph, cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has identified a new threat targeting cryptocurrency users through malware embedded in fake Microsoft Office extensions uploaded to the software hosting site SourceForge. The malicious listing, named “officepackage,” includes genuine Microsoft Office add-ins but conceals a malware known as ClipBanker. This malware replaces a copied crypto wallet address on a computer's clipboard with the attacker's address, posing a significant risk to users who typically copy wallet addresses instead of typing them. If a device is infected with ClipBanker, the victim's funds could be redirected to an unexpected destination. Kaspersky's Anti-Malware Research Team highlighted that the fake project's page on SourceForge mimics a legitimate developer tool page, displaying office add-ins and download buttons, and can appear in search results. Another feature of the malware's infection chain involves transmitting infected device information, such as IP addresses, country, and usernames, to hackers via Telegram. The malware is also capable of scanning the infected system for signs of previous installations or antivirus software and deleting itself if detected. The cybersecurity firm noted that some files in the bogus download are suspiciously small, raising concerns as office applications are typically larger, even when compressed. Other files are padded with junk data to deceive users into believing they are installing genuine software. Attackers secure access to infected systems through various methods, including unconventional ones. While the primary target of the attack is cryptocurrency, deploying a miner and ClipBanker, attackers could potentially sell system access to more dangerous actors. The interface is in Russian, suggesting it may target Russian-speaking users, with telemetry indicating that 90% of potential victims are in Russia, where 4,604 users encountered the scheme between early January and late March. To mitigate the risk of falling victim to such attacks, Kaspersky advises downloading software only from trusted sources, as pirated programs and alternative download options carry higher risks. The company emphasized that distributing malware disguised as pirated software is not a new tactic, and attackers continually seek ways to make their websites appear legitimate. Other cybersecurity firms have also raised concerns about emerging forms of malware targeting crypto users. Threat Fabric reported a new family of malware capable of launching a fake overlay to deceive Android users into providing their crypto seed phrases, effectively taking control of the device.",04-09-2025

According to CoinDesk, Rootstock, a pioneering project in the Bitcoin ecosystem, is advancing its efforts to enhance Bitcoin's utility and interoperability through the development of layer-2 networks. The project is leveraging 'BitVMX,' a modified version of the BitVM programming language, to achieve this goal. Rootstock is on the verge of releasing software development kits (SDKs) that will enable developers to create their own Bitcoin layer-2 solutions using BitVMX, as stated by founder Sergio Lerner. SDKs are essential tools that allow third-party developers to build applications on specific platforms or frameworks. Lerner expressed confidence in the project's progress, noting, ""We are very close to having all the pieces ready for people to start building their own solutions on top of BitVMX."" The BitVMX project builds on the BitVM paradigm introduced by Robin Linus in 2023, which outlines how Ethereum-style smart contracts could be implemented on Bitcoin. This development could significantly enhance Bitcoin's scalability by enabling the creation of faster, programmable layer-2 networks akin to those on Ethereum and other blockchains. Rootstock's collaboration with BitVMX contributors, including Fairgate and RootstockLabs, has led to a breakthrough in using BitVMX to verify zero-knowledge SNARKs, a crucial cryptographic component in many blockchain systems. Lerner emphasized the importance of transforming BitVMX into a platform, stating, ""There is a difference between a product and a platform: a product is closed but a platform is something you can easily plug in to and develop your own ideas on top of."" He believes that as BitVMX becomes a platform, it will foster competition among rollups and sidechains, ultimately driving adoption. Lerner, a Buenos Aires-based programmer known for his early Bitcoin research and contributions to Ethereum development, expressed concerns about Bitcoin's future. He warned that if Bitcoin remains solely a store of value, it may not fulfill its intended purpose as ""money for the people."" He stressed the importance of making Bitcoin payments and holding BTC in self-custody, asserting that creating layers for Bitcoin is crucial, with BitVM protocols, particularly BitVMX, playing a key role. RootstockLabs and Fairgate have formed an alliance, known as 'BitVMX Force,' to expand Bitcoin's utility using BitVMX. This collaboration includes blockchain infrastructure engineering firm Input | Output (IO). The alliance aims to focus on standardization and protocol enhancements to facilitate future Bitcoin soft-forks and infrastructure improvements. Fairgate CEO Jonatan Altszul highlighted the synergy between Rootstock and IO, noting their respective initiatives to bridge Bitcoin with other platforms and enhance asset movement across blockchains.

Binance,"MEV Bot Loses $180,000 in Ether Due to Exploit
According to Cointelegraph, a maximal extractable value (MEV) bot suffered a significant loss of approximately $180,000 in Ether after an attacker exploited a vulnerability in its access control systems. On April 8, blockchain security firm SlowMist reported that the bot lost 116.7 Ether (ETH) due to inadequate access control measures. Threat researcher Vladimir Sobolev, known as Officer’s Notes on X, explained that the attacker took advantage of a flaw in the bot, leading it to exchange its ETH for a dummy token. Sobolev noted that the attacker created a malicious pool within the same transaction to execute the exploit. He emphasized that the incident could have been avoided if the MEV bot owner had implemented more stringent access controls. In response to the exploit, the MEV bot's owner quickly proposed a bounty to the attacker just 25 minutes after the incident. Subsequently, the owner deployed a new MEV bot with enhanced access control validation. Sobolev drew parallels between this exploit and a similar event in 2023, where MEV bots lost $25 million after being compromised. On April 23, 2023, bots engaged in sandwich trades fell victim to a rogue validator, resulting in significant losses. MEV bots on Ethereum are designed to exploit maximal extractable value, which is the maximum profit that can be extracted from block production by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block. These bots monitor Ethereum’s pool of pending transactions to identify potential profits, often engaging in front-run, back-run, or sandwich transactions. This practice has sparked controversy as it can siphon value from regular users during periods of high volatility or congestion. Despite the controversies, MEV bots remain in use, attracting both experienced traders and beginners seeking profits. However, newcomers often fall prey to scams involving fraudulent MEV bot guides. Sobolev highlighted a rise in fake tutorials online, which claim to teach users how to earn money with MEV bots but instead provide false installation instructions. ""Very often, this will simply allow hackers to steal your money,"" Sobolev warned. He advised users to thoroughly verify their resources to avoid becoming victims of scams. The rise of fraudulent guides underscores the need for caution and due diligence in the crypto space, where the potential for profit is often accompanied by significant risks.",04-08-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin's Potential to Rival Gold as Inflation Hedge Gains Attention
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin may begin to capture market share from gold over the next decade as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. This perspective was shared by Blockstream CEO Adam Back during a discussion at Paris Blockchain Week 2025. Back emphasized that rising inflation and monetary instability across global economies could drive broader adoption of Bitcoin (BTC). He likened the cryptocurrency to gold, highlighting its scarcity and increasing recognition as a store of value, despite a 30% correction from its all-time high above $109,000. Back pointed out that inflation continues to affect global economies, with major currencies like the US dollar and the euro experiencing significant supply increases over the past five years. This trend, he suggested, might encourage Bitcoin's adoption as a hedge against monetary destabilization. ""Eventually, that money is used to buy all the goods. So eventually they will go up by that much, particularly hard assets like housing, anything physical long term,"" Back explained. He projected an inflation rate of 10% to 15% for the next decade, a return difficult to achieve with stocks or housing rentals. Consequently, Bitcoin could compete with gold and begin to take on some of its use cases, such as serving as a geopolitical hedge. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland anticipates the 10-year inflation rate to average 2.18% annually, based on data published on March 12. However, alternative data suggests a potential rise in inflation over the next five years. A consumer survey from the University of Michigan, released on March 28, indicated that consumer inflation expectations have surged to 5% for the next year and 4.1% over the next five years, heightening economic concerns. In addition to growing monetary instability, the approval of US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and a more crypto-friendly US administration under U.S. President Donald Trump may further boost Bitcoin's adoption as an inflation hedge. Back noted that US regulators have approved the ETFs, and the current administration is removing negative regulations that previously hindered crypto adoption. He argued that private investors should adopt Bitcoin before institutional or governmental entities, as governmental involvement could trigger competitive accumulation among nations. On March 7, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin reserve using Bitcoin seized from criminal cases, a move seen by industry leaders as a significant step toward integrating Bitcoin into the traditional financial system.",04-08-2025

Binance,"Colossal Biosciences Revives Extinct Dire Wolves Using Advanced Biotechnology
According to ShibDaily, Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company, has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by successfully reviving dire wolves, a species that has been extinct for nearly 10,000 years. This marks the first instance of an animal being brought back from extinction through advanced biotechnological methods. The dire wolves, famously associated with the Stark family in George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones, have been brought back to life using DNA extracted from two fossils. The process involved 20 genetic edits to the DNA of a gray wolf, the dire wolf’s closest living relative. Colossal Biosciences has successfully bred three dire wolves using CRISPR technology, selectively enhancing traits such as the snowy white coats characteristic of the extinct species. The three dire wolves, consisting of two male adolescents and one female puppy, are currently residing in a secure, 2,000-acre preserve at a confidential location. The company estimates that these wolves will grow to weigh between 130 and 150 pounds as they mature. Colossal CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm expressed excitement about the achievement, stating that the team used DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to create healthy dire wolf puppies. While many associate dire wolves with fantasy, they were real animals that once roamed the Americas. They are believed to have gone extinct around 10,000 years ago, likely due to the loss of large herbivores they depended on for food. Fossil evidence of these ancient canines has been uncovered at L.A.’s La Brea Tar Pits, where over 3,600 dire wolf remains have been found. The museum next door showcases around 400 of these skulls, offering visitors a glimpse into the past of this long-extinct species. Colossal Biosciences has announced its goal to reintroduce the dire wolf as a thriving species. The company plans to establish ecological preserves for these restored creatures on Indigenous lands across North America, ensuring their sustainable future in the wild. This achievement marks a significant milestone not only for Game of Thrones and fantasy enthusiasts but also for the field of biotechnology. It demonstrates the potential of modern technology to restore extinct species, pushing the limits of genetic engineering and de-extinction efforts.",04-08-2025

Binance,"Dalio Highlights Deeper Global Issues Beyond Tariffs
According to BlockBeats, billionaire hedge fund manager and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has expressed that while tariffs are a significant focus for markets and the economy, deeper global issues should not be overlooked. Dalio emphasized that we are currently experiencing a 'classic collapse' of monetary, political, and geopolitical orders, a phenomenon that may occur only once in a lifetime but has been observed multiple times throughout history.Dalio advises against being distracted by short-term events like tariffs and instead recommends focusing on the interplay of five major forces: economic, political, geopolitical, natural, and technological. He suggests that studying similar historical cycles, such as monetary crises, can aid in predicting future developments.""The current changes are part of a historic long-term cycle, with tariffs being merely a surface issue. The true driving factors are the structural collapses of monetary, political, and geopolitical orders. Understanding the interaction of these forces and learning from historical experiences will better prepare us for the future,"" Dalio stated.",04-08-2025

Binance,"Potential Fed Intervention as Credit Spreads Widen
According to BlockBeats, Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Matcham suggests that if credit spreads continue to widen and the bond market prices in a recession, the Federal Reserve may be prompted to intervene. Typically, an increase in credit spreads can lead to difficulties in corporate financing and a weakening job market. If high-yield bond spreads expand to 500 basis points, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell might change his policy stance, similar to his actions in 2018. Powell's stance last Friday was relatively firm, primarily because the recent stock market plunge was event-driven, and non-farm payroll data remained strong. Additionally, with tariffs potentially driving inflation higher in the future, Powell is cautious about using policy measures prematurely. Currently, high-yield bond spreads have reached 454 basis points, nearing the critical threshold of 500 basis points. The report indicates a 51% probability of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's May meeting, suggesting that further adjustments in the bond market are necessary to prompt Powell to shift his policy stance, which could potentially lead to a stock market rebound.",04-08-2025

Binance,"Australia's ASIC Targets 95 Companies in Crypto Scam Crackdown
According to Cointelegraph, Australia's corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), has received approval from the Federal Court of Australia to shut down 95 companies suspected of engaging in crypto investment and romance scams, commonly referred to as 'pig butchering.' This decision was made on just and equitable grounds after ASIC discovered that most of these companies were incorporated using false information. These entities were allegedly set up under the guise of providing legitimate services but were instead believed to be defrauding their victims, as stated by ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court in an April 8 announcement. Justice Angus Stewart, in an April 4 court ruling, highlighted a recurring pattern of scam activity associated with 'pig butchering' after reviewing 48 'Reviews of Misconduct' from 17 companies accused of facilitating romance scams. The judgment, delivered on March 21, underscores the deceptive nature of these scams, where perpetrators build fake relationships with victims to gain their trust before persuading them to invest in fraudulent crypto or financial schemes. The securities regulator suspects that much of this scam activity originates from Southeast Asia. Insolvency and restructuring experts Catherine Conneely and Thomas Birch of Cor Cordis have been appointed as joint liquidators for the 95 companies. The provisional liquidators have received nearly 1,500 claims from 'investors,' totaling over $35.8 million, according to the court order. These claimants are spread across 14 countries, including Australia, the United States, Cameroon, Ghana, India, Nepal, the Philippines, and France. The liquidators found that only three of the 95 firms possessed assets, leading to a recommendation that the remaining 92 companies be wound up and immediately deregistered. ASIC has also been actively shutting down scam websites, removing approximately 130 each week, totaling over 10,000 sites, including more than 7,200 fake investment platform scams and 1,564 phishing scams. Despite these efforts, ASIC warns that scams are like hydras, with new ones emerging as others are shut down, emphasizing the ongoing threat of scams and identity fraud.

According to Cointelegraph, Spanish authorities have apprehended six individuals involved in a sophisticated global investment scam that exploited artificial intelligence to defraud over $20 million from at least 208 victims. The operation, which utilized deepfake advertisements featuring prominent personalities, promised high returns on cryptocurrency investments. Victims were targeted through manipulated ads and were often deceived multiple times by the fraudsters. The scammers initially lured victims with promises of lucrative crypto investments, only to steal their funds. Subsequently, they contacted the victims again, posing as investment managers and claiming that the stolen funds were frozen, offering to recover them for a fee. Spanish police revealed that victims, desperate to retrieve their money, often fell for this secondary scam. The fraudsters further exploited the situation by impersonating Europol agents or UK lawyers, suggesting that the funds could be returned if victims paid taxes in the country where the money was allegedly blocked. Spanish police have charged the arrested individuals with fraud, money laundering, and document falsification within a criminal organization. During the raid on the alleged leader's residence, authorities seized numerous electronic devices, a simulated weapon, and extensive documentation. The syndicate reportedly established numerous fake companies to channel the stolen funds and used multiple false identities, with the leader alone employing over 50 different aliases. The investigation has also identified several individuals linked to the scam in other countries, highlighting the extensive reach of the criminal network.

Binance,"Trump Administration's Tariff Calculation Error Sparks Market Volatility
According to Odaily, scholars from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) have identified a significant calculation error in the tariff policy recently announced by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The White House mistakenly used the retail price elasticity (0.25) instead of the correct import price elasticity (0.945) in their formula, resulting in an overestimation of tariff rates by approximately four times. If the correct value were applied, Cambodia's tariff rate would decrease from 49% to 13%, Vietnam's from 46% to 12.2%, and most countries would fall to the White House's minimum set rate of 10%. This error has led to substantial market fluctuations, with noticeable declines in stock markets across the United States, Asia, and Europe. Some AEI economists have accused the White House of deliberately manipulating the figures to achieve the high tariffs desired by President Trump.

Binance,"Lawsuit Filed Against DHS Over Alleged Bitcoin Creator Information
According to Cointelegraph, a legal battle has emerged as crypto lawyer James Murphy has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), seeking information on the alleged creators of Bitcoin. The lawsuit, filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), is based on claims made by DHS Special Agent Rana Saoud during a 2019 conference. Saoud reportedly stated that her colleagues had met with four individuals believed to be involved in Bitcoin's creation. Murphy, known as MetaLawMan on social media, is requesting access to notes, emails, and other documents related to the purported interview. He argues that if the meeting took place as described, there should be records detailing its content. Speaking at the OffshoreAlert Conference in Miami, Saoud mentioned that DHS agents traveled to California to meet with the individuals, aiming to understand their motives and the ultimate purpose of Bitcoin. Murphy has expressed his determination to pursue the case to its conclusion if the DHS resists disclosure, although he acknowledges the possibility that the agents may have been mistaken about the identities of those they interviewed. Assisting Murphy in this legal endeavor is former Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Field, who specializes in FOIA litigation. The FOIA is designed to enhance transparency and accountability by allowing public access to government-held information. This lawsuit is part of a broader effort to uncover the identity of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite numerous attempts, the true identity remains elusive. A recent HBO documentary controversially suggested that Bitcoin cypherpunk Peter Todd was the creator, a claim Todd and many industry experts have dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Other figures such as Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and the late Hal Finney have also been speculated to be Satoshi, though they have consistently denied these claims. Within the Bitcoin community, opinions are divided on whether revealing Satoshi's identity would benefit or harm the cryptocurrency. Some fear it could undermine Bitcoin's decentralized nature and endanger Satoshi, while others seek assurance that Bitcoin was not a government creation. The ongoing debate highlights the complexities surrounding Bitcoin's origins and the implications of potentially uncovering its creator.",04-08-2025

Binance,"Federal Reserve Chair Signals Hawkish Shift Amid Market Unawareness
According to PANews, a leading observer closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's actions has noted that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell quietly signaled a hawkish shift last Friday, which has largely gone unnoticed by most market participants. Tim Duy, Chief U.S. Economist at SGH Macro Advisors, shared this perspective as the federal funds futures market continues to increase bets on a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The CME FedWatch tool indicates that the probability of a rate cut in May has surged from 14% last week to 60%, with expectations that rates will drop to 3% by the end of the year. The yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, which is highly sensitive to monetary policy changes, fell by 8 basis points to 3.59%. Duy remarked, ""We anticipated Powell would lean hawkish last Friday, but he went further amid a stock market plunge, and the market may have overlooked this critical signal, which is alarming."" Powell introduced new language in his inflation expectations statement, emphasizing concerns over long-term inflation expectations for the first time, rather than just the one-year outlook. More importantly, there was a subtle change in forward guidance: he removed two sentences from the March 7 statement that ruled out the possibility of rate hikes. These sentences stated, ""If the economy remains strong but inflation does not consistently fall back to 2%, we will extend the policy restriction period; if the job market unexpectedly weakens or inflation falls more than expected, we will accordingly ease policy."" Duy analyzed, ""Although rate hikes were not explicitly mentioned, the option is no longer explicitly ruled out. Powell was aware that the market was in free fall when he adjusted his wording, which was not a sign of dullness but a deliberate move.""",04-07-2025

Rising global economic uncertainty spurred by U.S. tariffs triggers renewed outflows from crypto exchange-traded products, reversing a two-week inflow trend.Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed a sharp reversal last week, shedding $240 million in investor capital amid mounting concerns over the economic fallout from U.S. trade tariffs, according to the latest CoinShares report published on April 7.The outflows came after two consecutive weeks of inflows totaling $870 million, leaving digital asset ETP holdings at approximately $133 billion.“The renewed capital flight reflects investor caution due to the uncertainty surrounding global trade tensions,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.Bitcoin ETPs Flip Monthly Flows NegativeBitcoin (BTC) ETPs led the downturn with $207 million in weekly outflows, dragging monthly flows into negative territory for the first time in 2025.

Bitcoin drops below $75K while XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin breach critical support levels amid global economic turmoil.April 7, 2025 — The cryptocurrency market entered freefall early Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) dipping below the key $75,000 level and major altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) collapsing by over 20% in 24 hours.Driven by mounting macroeconomic concerns, nearly $1 billion in liquidations, and escalating global trade tensions, the sell-off is intensifying as markets await the U.S. stock market open.According to CoinDesk data, the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index slumped 12%, reflecting a widespread risk-off sentiment sweeping across the digital asset landscape.Altcoins Breach Key Support LevelsXRP fell to $1.70, breaking below its 200-day moving average, signaling a potential drop toward $1.50, according to technical analysts.SOL plunged under $100, marking a 64% correction from its all-time high, and breaching its 50-day moving average.DOGE crashed to $0.13, wiping out weeks of gains, as momentum traders offloaded positions amid rising volatility.Tariff Tensions and Global Uncertainty Trigger PanicThe panic was exacerbated by President Trump’s 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, along with a doubled 20% tariff on Chinese imports. In response, China is considering front-loaded stimulus measures, further rattling investor confidence.The market turmoil has sparked a flight to safety, with investors rotating into gold and the Japanese yen, traditionally viewed as safe-haven assets.“We expect crypto markets to dip once U.S. markets open,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. “Asia’s decline reinforced that belief. Only coordinated tariff deals or relief from major players like China or Japan could restore confidence.”Traders See Extended Bear Market ConditionsAnalysts warn that current conditions echo a broader bear market, with rallies seen as opportunities to exit risk rather than accumulate.“This is classic bear market behavior,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. “Investors are adjusting to a new economic reality. Unless catalysts emerge, we expect more downside pressure and shaken confidence ahead.”Despite the carnage, some analysts suggest Bitcoin’s relative strength compared to equities and a possible future rally alongside gold may signal a long-term decoupling from traditional risk assets.

Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) have each broken below key support levels, signaling potential for further downside if bulls fail to reclaim lost ground.DOGE Price Analysis: Drops 15%, Risks Retest of $0.14Dogecoin (DOGE) has fallen to $0.16, down nearly 15% in the last 24 hours, breaching a key support at $0.18, which served as the lower boundary of a consolidation zone since early March.On the 4-hour chart, a death cross has appeared — the 50-period SMA crossing below the 200-period SMA, often interpreted as a bearish signal.Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 28, indicating oversold conditions and a chance of a short-term bounce.However, the 20-day EMA at $0.21 acts as a strong resistance.If sellers maintain momentum, DOGE may drop to $0.14, a level last visited in December 2024.XRP Price Analysis: Below $2, Eyes on Bearish BreakdownXRP has slipped to $1.90, recording a 14% daily loss, and falling below the psychological $2.00 support — previously a key bullish structure.The move confirms a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, typically preceding further downside.The 21-day EMA at $2.20 now acts as overhead resistance.RSI is approaching 30, showing weak buyer interest amid persistent sell pressure.If support fails to hold, XRP could retest the $1.70–$1.80 zone, with extended downside targeting $1.50.ADA Price Analysis: Slides to $0.55, Descending Triangle Breakdown in PlayCardano (ADA) is trading at $0.55, down over 12%, and has broken below its 50-day SMA, ending weeks of support since mid-March.The breakdown confirms a descending triangle pattern, a classic bearish formation.MACD has crossed bearish, and RSI at 38 suggests fading momentum.ADA’s next support lies around $0.40, with a potential deeper correction toward $0.35 if that level fails.To invalidate this bearish setup, ADA must reclaim $0.60 and hold above it.Altcoins at Risk as Macro Pressure BuildsThe latest drop in DOGE, XRP, and ADA highlights the fragility of altcoin markets under current macroeconomic stress.

Binance,"Cryptocurrency Market Faces Volatility Amid Global Economic Tensions
According to CoinDesk, major cryptocurrencies are experiencing significant volatility, with XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) falling below crucial technical support levels as of early Monday. This downturn is largely attributed to macroeconomic uncertainties arising from a global tariff conflict, which hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has described as an ""economic nuclear war."" The impact of these tensions is being felt across markets, from cryptocurrencies to global equities, with Bitcoin trading below $79,000 and major tokens experiencing a 14% decline. XRP, the digital asset that powers the XRP Ledger, has dropped to $1.90, marking a 14% decrease. On the daily chart, XRP has breached its critical support level of $2.00, which previously served as a psychological and technical foundation. This breakdown completes a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating potential further downside. Technical indicators support this bearish outlook, with the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.20 acting as resistance after XRP's failure to reclaim it in recent weeks. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) has fallen into negative territory, hovering near 30, suggesting that selling pressure is outweighing buying interest. Cardano's ADA token is currently trading at 55 cents, down 12% over the past 24 hours, and has fallen below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), a critical support level that has sustained the price since mid-March. This breach on the daily chart aligns with a broader descending triangle pattern, indicating continued bearish control. The RSI for ADA is at 38, nearing oversold territory, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line dipping below the MACD line. The next support level is approximately 35 cents, a level tested in late 2024, but a break below could push ADA toward $0.40, representing a 30% drop from current levels. Bulls would need to reclaim 60 cents and turn it into support to counter the bearish outlook, though macroeconomic headwinds, driven by tariff threats and a 20% crypto market cap loss this year, present significant challenges. Dogecoin (DOGE), a popular memecoin, has fallen to $0.16, down nearly 15% in the last 24 hours. It has broken through support at 18 cents, a level that has served as the base of a consolidation range since early March. On the 4-hour chart, a death cross has emerged, with the 50-period SMA crossing below the 200-period SMA, signaling a potential trend reversal to the downside. The RSI for DOGE is deep in oversold territory at 28, suggesting possible short-term relief, but the 20-day EMA at $0.21 presents a significant resistance. If bearish momentum continues, DOGE could decline to $0.14, aligning with its December 2024 lows.",04-07-2025

According to BlockBeats, data from Etherscan indicates a significant increase in Ethereum gas fees, currently reported at 113.327 Gwei. This surge reflects heightened activity on the Ethereum network, impacting transaction costs for users. The rise in gas fees is often associated with increased demand for network resources, which can be influenced by various factors such as market trends, network congestion, or specific events driving higher transaction volumes.

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Credit Spreads Surge to 8-Month High — Is the Bond Market Signaling a Bitcoin Crash or Safe-Haven Shift?
Widening credit spreads are emerging as a potential warning sign for risk assets like Bitcoin (BTC), with analysts eyeing the bond market as a “canary in the coal mine” for broader market stress.The IEI/HYG ratio — which compares the iShares 3–7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEI) with the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) — has spiked to its highest level since the March 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, signaling mounting investor caution. This surge marks the sharpest rise since that crisis, when Bitcoin bottomed below $20,000.Credit spreads, which represent the yield difference between safe government bonds and riskier corporate debt, tend to widen when risk aversion increases. Historically, these expansions have coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin and other risk-on assets, such as during the August 2024 yen carry trade unwind that saw BTC fall over 33%.Yet, despite the rise in spreads and broader financial market stress, Bitcoin has shown resilience, outperforming traditional equities in recent sessions. Some analysts now argue that BTC is beginning to decouple from traditional risk assets, evolving into a potential safe haven or “U.S. isolation hedge” amid escalating macroeconomic uncertainty.The key question is whether this latest spike in credit spreads marks a peak — or if further tightening lies ahead. If financial conditions continue to deteriorate, the impact could ripple across crypto markets, unless Bitcoin’s emerging safe-haven narrative gains further traction, according to CoinDesk.",04-07-2025

Binance,"Solana Staked for 3,000 Years: A Symbolic Move in Crypto
According to Cointelegraph, an anonymous crypto user has made a notable move by staking a small amount of Solana (SOL) for an extraordinary duration of 3,000 years. This unusual action was highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, which reported that the user staked $0.05 worth of SOL in 2023, with the stake set to unlock in the year 5138. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, suggested that this move might be a symbolic gesture reflecting confidence in Solana's long-term potential. Liu emphasized that legacy staking is more than just locking assets; it represents a mindset focused on long-term conviction rather than short-term gains. He believes that such an approach not only builds portfolios but also establishes enduring legacies. Currently, Solana is trading at $102, as per CoinMarketCap. A report from asset manager Bitwise forecasts that the token's value could rise significantly, potentially reaching between $2,300 and over $6,000 by 2030. While it's impossible to predict the exact worth of the staked SOL when it unlocks in thousands of years, Liu noted that even a modest annual appreciation of 2–5% could result in exponential growth over 3,000 years. This highlights the power of long-term compounding in financial markets. The staking of Solana for such an extended period has sparked discussions among users on X, with some speculating that it could be an attempt to create generational wealth or simply a whimsical stunt. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at blockchain platform Komodo, described the 3,000-year stake as a ""meme trade"" that could become a notable entry on the Solana blockchain. He pondered the future, questioning what the world and the blockchain landscape might look like in 3,000 years. Stadelmann also speculated that others might attempt to surpass this stake with even longer-term plays. Currently, Solana offers staking rewards ranging from 5% to 8%, depending on the platform and validator choice. In comparison, Cardano (ADA) offers starting rewards of around 2%, while Ether (ETH) provides staking rewards between 2% and 7%. Recently, four Solana whales profited over $200 million from a staking play initiated in April 2021, when they staked 1.79 million Solana, valued at $37.7 million at the time. A similar unlock is anticipated in 2028.",04-07-2025

Staking allows investors to lock their virtual assets to support blockchain networks and earn returns.

According to BlockBeats, Elon Musk has openly criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's chief trade advisor, Peter Navarro, and called for a zero-tariff free trade zone between the U.S. and Europe. This stance marks a significant divergence from the Trump administration's recent tariff policies. Following the announcement of new tariffs by Trump, which led to a sharp decline in the stock market, Musk broke his silence on trade policies. He criticized Navarro on social media, questioning the value of his Harvard economics background and suggesting it leads to arrogance rather than wisdom. Musk's comments came after a user defended Navarro's expertise in tariffs. Musk responded bluntly, stating that Navarro has not achieved anything significant. This public disagreement highlights a growing rift within the U.S. economic strategy. In a surprising move, Musk advocated for the elimination of trade barriers during a video appearance at an Italian political event. He suggested that the U.S. and Europe should ideally move towards a zero-tariff status, effectively creating a free trade zone between the two regions. The White House has yet to respond to Musk's remarks. Notably, other senior officials in Trump's economic team, including Stephen Miran, also hold Harvard economics degrees. Navarro has been actively defending the tariff plan on television, claiming it will generate approximately $600 billion in new revenue annually. Trump has described these tariffs as an ""economic revolution,"" asserting that large corporations will benefit from upcoming tax cuts. Musk's relationship with the Trump administration may be cooling, as Trump indicated that Musk might step back from government work in the coming months. As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk recently stated that much of his work on reducing the $1 trillion deficit is nearing completion.

According to Cointelegraph, a New York appeals court recently encountered an unusual situation when Jerome Dewald, a defendant in an employment dispute, attempted to use an AI-generated avatar to present his legal arguments. The incident occurred in late March, during a video livestream of the hearing. Dewald, representing himself, submitted the avatar to articulate his case, marking a notable instance of artificial intelligence tools making their way into legal proceedings. Justice Sallie Manzanet-Daniels quickly intervened, questioning whether the avatar was serving as legal counsel. Dewald, 74, clarified that he had generated the avatar himself and that it was not a real person. The judge expressed her displeasure, noting that Dewald had previously appeared before the court and had been able to testify verbally. She emphasized her disapproval of being misled and questioned whether Dewald was experiencing any ailment that prevented him from speaking directly. The judge further admonished Dewald, stating that the courtroom was not a platform for launching his business ventures, and instructed him to shut off the video. Dewald later apologized, explaining that he believed the AI avatar would present his arguments more effectively than he could. He had applied to the court for permission to use a prerecorded video and collaborated with a San Francisco tech company to create the avatar. Dewald initially attempted to generate a digital replica of himself but was constrained by time before the hearing. Reflecting on the court's reaction, Dewald acknowledged that the judges were quite upset, admitting, ""They chewed me up pretty good."" This incident underscores the growing challenges as artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into the legal sector. In 2023, a New York lawyer faced criticism for citing fictitious cases generated by ChatGPT in a legal brief against a Colombian airline.

Binance,"Bitcoin Network Achieves Historic Hashrate Milestone Amid Market Volatility
According to Cointelegraph, the Bitcoin network has reached a significant milestone in its 16-year history, with its hashrate surpassing 1 Zetahash per second (ZH/s) for the first time. This achievement was recorded on April 5, when mempool.space data indicated a peak of 1.025 ZH/s, while BTC Frame data reported a slightly earlier peak of 1.02 ZH/s on April 4. Coinwarz data also noted a high of 1.1 ZH/s on April 4 at block height 890,915, although it suggests that the network first crossed the 1 ZH/s threshold on March 24. However, by April 7, the hashrate had fallen below 0.95 ZH/s. The discrepancies in reported hashrate figures arise from different methodologies used by various trackers. These differences can be attributed to factors such as the timing of block measurements, difficulty adjustments, and the specific Bitcoin nodes and mining pools from which data is sourced. Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp has highlighted that using a single ""trailing block"" for estimation, as opposed to five, can result in a variance of over 0.04 ZH/s. Mitchell Askew, head analyst at Blockware Solutions, cautioned that raw hashrate metrics might be misleading due to random block time variations. He noted that Bitcoin's 30-day moving average hashrate remains around 0.845 ZH/s. Despite these discrepancies, reaching 1 ZH/s is a remarkable achievement for the Bitcoin network, underscoring its immense computational power and growing decentralization. This milestone enhances the network's security, significantly reducing the risk of a 51% attack. The network's hashrate has increased 1,000 times since January 2016, when it first reached 1 Exahash per second (EH/s). In comparison, Litecoin, the second-largest proof-of-work cryptocurrency network, has a hashrate of 2.49 Petahashes per second, making it approximately 40,000 times less powerful than Bitcoin. Mitchell Askew noted that the surge in hashrate aligns with the expansion of commercial Bitcoin mining operations, as firms invest in more efficient machines. However, he warned that less efficient miners might struggle unless Bitcoin's price rebounds in the coming months. MARA Holdings is currently the largest Bitcoin miner, with over 50 EH/s of computing power. The majority of hashrate is directed to mining pools such as Foundry USA Pool and AntPool. At least 24 publicly listed companies are involved in Bitcoin mining, including Riot Platforms, Core Scientific, CleanSpark, Hut 8 Mining, and TeraWulf. This historic hashrate achievement coincides with a sharp market downturn, as Bitcoin's price dropped nearly 10% over four days to $78,750. This decline is part of a broader market trend, with U.S. stocks experiencing a record $6.6 trillion loss on April 3 and 4. Analysts attribute much of this market volatility to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans, which have fueled recession fears.",04-07-2025

According to PANews, Goldman Sachs has adjusted its expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, suggesting a higher risk of policy easing if an economic recession occurs. The investment bank now anticipates the Fed will initiate a series of rate cuts in June, earlier than its previous July forecast, as part of a precautionary easing cycle. In a scenario where the U.S. avoids recession, Goldman Sachs expects the Fed to implement three consecutive 25 basis point cuts, bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. However, if the economy does enter a recession, the Fed is predicted to respond with more aggressive measures, potentially reducing rates by approximately 200 basis points next year. Considering the increased likelihood of a recession, Goldman Sachs' current weighted forecast indicates a total rate cut of 130 basis points in 2025, up from the previous estimate of 105 basis points. As of last Friday's market close, this outlook aligns closely with current market expectations.",04-07-2025

According to Cointelegraph, stablecoins are considered a crucial tool for the United States government to uphold the US dollar's supremacy in global financial markets. Bryan Pellegrino, CEO and founder of LayerZero Labs, emphasized the strategic importance of dollar-pegged tokens in an interview. LayerZero Labs, known for its LayerZero interoperability protocol, was recently selected by Wyoming as the distribution partner for the state's stablecoin initiative. Pellegrino highlighted the cross-border accessibility of stablecoins as a significant factor driving demand for the US dollar, describing them as a powerful mechanism to influence other currencies worldwide, particularly in countries experiencing high inflation like Argentina and Venezuela. Pellegrino anticipates growing support for stablecoins at both federal and state levels due to their potential to enhance the US dollar's position in foreign exchange markets. He believes that stablecoins will create a financial moat around the US dollar's status as a global reserve currency. The increasing role of stablecoins in the financial ecosystem is evident, with Tether emerging as one of the largest buyers of US Treasury bills globally. Tether recently became the seventh-largest holder of US Treasuries, surpassing countries such as Canada, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. During the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the Trump administration plans to leverage stablecoins to reinforce US dollar hegemony, marking it as a top priority for officials in 2025. A 2023 report from Chainalysis revealed that over half of the digital asset value transferred to Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, was denominated in stablecoins. The appeal of stablecoins lies in their low transaction fees, relative stability, and near-instant settlement times, making them ideal for remittances and as stores of value in developing countries facing high inflation and capital controls.",04-06-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Price Dips Below $80K as Traders Eye Post-Tariff Rebound Despite ‘Black Monday’ Fears
Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the key $80,000 level heading into the April 6 weekly close, shedding 3% since the week’s start amid intensifying fears of a global market crash reminiscent of 1987’s Black Monday. However, crypto traders remain cautiously optimistic, as BTC continues to decouple from traditional markets in the face of macroeconomic headwinds.Stocks Dive, Bitcoin Holds Relative StrengthU.S. stock indices plunged nearly 6% on April 4, with over $8.2 trillion in market capitalization wiped out following President Trump’s sweeping trade tariff announcement. Commentators likened the week’s bloodbath to the 2008 financial crisis and even the October 1987 crash, with CNBC’s Jim Cramer warning that a repeat of the “Black Monday” collapse is “not off the table yet.”Meanwhile, Bitcoin dipped below $80,000, but analysts noted the move as relatively minor compared to the chaos in equities. At press time, BTC was trading near $79,700, down just 3% for the week, showcasing its increasing resilience to traditional market turmoil.“The VIX (Volatility Index) just closed at its highest level since the COVID crash in 2020, while BTC volatility is compressing — a rare divergence,” noted crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades. “This sets the stage for a major breakout in crypto next week.”Analysts Eye $150K–$220K Bitcoin Run as Safe Haven Appeal GrowsDespite short-term downside, bullish sentiment remains high among Bitcoin supporters. Some predict a massive upside move could follow this week’s volatility:Max Keiser boldly forecast a Bitcoin price surge to $220,000 by month-end, calling it the “ultimate safe haven” amid trillions fleeing collapsing equity markets.Crypto Caesar and CryptoElites both shared charts suggesting that BTC could soon begin its “last push” of the cycle — possibly targeting $150,000+.BTC Price Setup: Fakeout or Trend Reversal?Technical analysts are watching Bitcoin’s weekly structure closely. The recent dip to $76,000 is being compared to past ""fake breakdowns"", similar to the post-ETF dump in January and August 2024's correction.“This looks no different than the post-ETF and August crashes,” trader Cas Abbe said. “A weekly close above $92K would confirm the uptrend.”Still, some warn that Bitcoin remains vulnerable to global macro shocks, particularly if U.S. bond market volatility escalates, echoing the 2020 COVID-era ‘dash for cash.’Bottom LineAs global markets teeter under record-breaking sell-offs, Bitcoin’s modest drop below $80K appears relatively controlled — a signal of its growing maturity and safe-haven narrative. With compressed volatility and strong divergence from equities, many crypto analysts believe a decisive move is imminent.Next week’s trading sessions — particularly for stocks and U.S. Treasury yields — will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin breaks higher or joins the broader risk-asset retreat, according to Cointelegraph.BTC Support to Watch: $76KBullish Reclaim Target: $92KMarket Volatility Indicator: VIX at COVID-crash levelsMacro Trigger Ahead: Early-week market open + response to tariff sell-off",04-06-2025

Bitcoin (BTC) posted an 11.7% loss in Q1 2025, marking its weakest first-quarter performance since 2015, according to a report from NYDIG Research. The drop, driven by economic policy uncertainty, profit-taking, and escalating global trade tensions, has reignited debate about where the crypto market currently stands in its cycle.A Decade-Low Start for BitcoinBitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance ranked 12th out of the past 15 first quarters, a significant deviation from its typically strong early-year showings. The last time BTC opened a year this poorly was in 2015, amid a prolonged bear market following the Mt. Gox collapse. While the asset eventually staged a rebound, the weak start raises concerns for 2025’s trajectory.“The question isn’t whether Bitcoin is down—it’s what phase of the cycle we’re actually in,” noted NYDIG analysts. “This type of Q1 drawdown has historically signaled either mid-cycle volatility or the tail-end of a euphoric run.”Tariff Shock and Profit-Taking Drive VolatilityFollowing Donald Trump’s November election victory, crypto markets soared on optimism over pro-crypto regulation and a friendlier SEC stance. However, that bullish narrative was shaken in early April after Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs on global trade partners.The announcement triggered a $5.4 trillion wipeout in the U.S. equities market over two trading days, sending the Nasdaq 100 into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to 11-month lows.While Bitcoin initially showed resilience, slipping less than 4% during the equities rout, it has since dropped below $80,000, raising questions about whether macro-driven risk aversion could spread into crypto.Cycle Uncertainty: Is This a Midway Reset or a Topping Signal?Historically, Q1 losses have had mixed implications for BTC’s annual performance:In 2020, BTC dropped 9.4% in Q1 due to COVID fears, but ended the year up over 300%.In contrast, Q1 losses in 2014, 2018, and 2022 all preceded bear markets, reflecting the end of bull runs.“This time feels different, but the market’s still digesting conflicting signals,” said a senior NYDIG researcher. “Regulatory relief is bullish, but macro policy—especially tariffs—could pressure liquidity and risk appetite.”What to Watch NextApril market open: Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim support above $80K could determine short-term sentiment.Recession signals: Analysts have raised the U.S. recession odds above 60%, adding potential headwinds to crypto’s risk-on appeal.Bitcoin ETF flows and institutional inflows: Continued strength here may stabilize BTC despite macro turmoil.Bitcoin’s worst Q1 since 2015 has stoked uncertainty across the crypto space.

Binance,"CFPB's Role in Crypto Regulations Diminishes Amid Federal Shifts
According to Cointelegraph, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is expected to see a reduced role in cryptocurrency regulations as other federal agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and state-level regulators take on more significant responsibilities in shaping crypto policy. Ethan Ostroff, a partner at the Troutman Pepper Locke law firm, highlighted this shift, noting that the current administration is likely to witness a substantial pullback by the CFPB in favor of other regulatory bodies. Ostroff explained that state regulators, empowered by the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), could assume some of the CFPB's regulatory roles. However, he emphasized that certain regulatory functions would remain under the CFPB's jurisdiction due to established legal frameworks. He pointed to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) as key state-level entities poised to lead in crypto regulation. Despite the anticipated reduction in the CFPB's role, Ostroff clarified that the agency would not be dismantled during U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The CFPB's existence is safeguarded by statutory obligations and requirements that necessitate Congressional action for any significant changes. The Trump administration has targeted the CFPB as part of a broader initiative by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut government spending and reduce federal debt. Russell Vought, the newly appointed head of the CFPB, announced significant funding cuts and operational scale-backs shortly after taking office in February 2025. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a co-founder of the CFPB, criticized these moves, particularly targeting Elon Musk, whom she accused of dismantling the agency. Warren described Musk as a ""bank robber"" and argued that the Trump administration's actions aimed to undo consumer protection rules and exert greater control over the financial system. In a February 12 interview with Mother Jones, Warren stressed that the Executive Branch lacks the statutory authority to fully dismantle the CFPB, a process that requires Congressional approval. This ongoing debate highlights the complexities and challenges in balancing regulatory oversight and government efficiency in the evolving landscape of financial regulation.",04-06-2025

Binance,"Trump's Tariff Proposal Triggers Market Drop, Eyes on Upcoming Economic Data
According to PANews, market sentiment has sharply deteriorated following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a tariff proposal, intensifying concerns about global growth prospects and causing a significant drop in U.S. stock markets. On Friday, the S&P 500 index saw its market value plummet by $1.5 trillion, with a cumulative loss of $3.5 trillion over two trading days. Major tech stocks declined, and the Nasdaq index closed more than 20% below its record high from December last year, entering a technical bear market.Looking ahead to next week, the outlook on tariffs remains uncertain. Investors are advised to focus on potential agreements between the U.S. and other countries, which could help improve market sentiment. Without any agreements, and if more countries respond with tariffs, the market may face another challenging week.Key events for the upcoming week include:- Wednesday 02:00 (UTC+8): San Francisco Fed President Daly participates in a discussion on ""Fed Economic Outlook and Work.""- Wednesday 23:00 (UTC+8): Richmond Fed President Barkin delivers a speech.- Wednesday 21:30 (UTC+8): Dallas Fed President Logan gives a welcome address at an event.- Thursday 02:00 (UTC+8): Federal Reserve releases minutes from the March monetary policy meeting.- Thursday 20:30 (UTC+8): U.S. March CPI data and initial jobless claims for the week ending April 5.- Friday 00:00 (UTC+8): Chicago Fed President Goolsbee speaks at the New York Economic Club.- Friday 00:30 (UTC+8): Philadelphia Fed President Harker discusses fintech.- Friday 20:30 (UTC+8): U.S. March PPI data.- Friday 22:00 (UTC+8): St. Louis Fed President Mussa speaks on U.S. economy and monetary policy.- Friday 22:00 (UTC+8): U.S. April one-year inflation rate preliminary estimate and University of Michigan consumer sentiment index preliminary value.- Friday 23:00 (UTC+8): New York Fed President Williams discusses economic outlook and monetary policy.Given the current uncertainties, dollar traders will focus on the U.S. March CPI data set to be released next Thursday.

Binance,"U.S. Recession Odds Rise Amid Tariff Concerns
According to Cointelegraph, traders on the Kalshi prediction market have placed the likelihood of a U.S. recession in 2025 at 61%, following a significant tariff order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on April 2. The prediction market uses the standard definition of a recession, which involves two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, as reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The odds of a recession have nearly doubled since March 20 and align closely with the 60% probability on Polymarket, another prediction platform. The macroeconomic outlook for 2025 has worsened rapidly after President Trump's tariff order, which led to a sell-off in capital markets and raised concerns about a prolonged bear market. The executive order established a 10% baseline tariff rate for all countries, with varying ""reciprocal"" rates for trading partners with existing tariffs on U.S. imports. This announcement caused an immediate stock market decline, erasing over $5 trillion in shareholder value within days. Market analysts warn of a potential extended trade war that could negatively affect global markets and suppress risk asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. Despite these developments, President Trump remains optimistic, asserting that the tariffs will ultimately strengthen the U.S. economy and address trade imbalances. ""The markets are going to boom,"" he stated on April 3, describing the current market downturn as a predictable phase of the process. Meanwhile, asset manager Anthony Pompliano speculated that President Trump may have intentionally triggered market declines to lower interest rates. He pointed to the reduction in 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields, which fell from approximately 4.66% in January 2025 to 4.00% by April 5, as evidence of this strategy. President Trump has also urged Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to reduce short-term interest rates, suggesting in an April 4 Truth Social post that it would be an opportune moment for such a move.",04-05-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin Bull Market Cycle May Have Ended, Says CryptoQuant CEO
According to Odaily, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, shared insights on the X platform suggesting that the Bitcoin bull market cycle might have concluded. He explained this through the concept of realized market value in blockchain data. When Bitcoin enters a blockchain wallet, it is considered a 'buy,' and when it exits, it is seen as a 'sell.' This concept helps estimate the average cost basis for each wallet, which, when multiplied by the amount of BTC held, results in the total realized market value. This value is often viewed as the total capital entering the Bitcoin market through actual on-chain activity, while market value is based on the latest trading price on exchanges. Ju noted that when selling pressure is low, even small purchases can drive up prices, thus increasing market value. Strategy has capitalized on this by issuing convertible bonds and using the proceeds to buy Bitcoin, resulting in a book value growth of their Bitcoin holdings that far exceeds the actual capital invested. However, when selling pressure is high, even significant purchases fail to affect the price, as seen when Bitcoin's trading price neared $100,000, leading to substantial market volume but little price change. Realized market value indicates the amount of actual funds entering the market, while market value reflects how prices respond. If realized market value is increasing but market value is stagnant or declining, it suggests capital is flowing in without a corresponding price increase—a bearish signal. Conversely, if realized market value remains stable while market value surges, it indicates that even small amounts of new capital are driving prices up—a bullish signal. Currently, the data points to the former scenario, where capital is entering the market but prices are not reacting, characteristic of a bear market. In summary, a bull market is characterized by small capital driving price increases, whereas a bear market occurs when even large capital cannot push prices up. The current data clearly indicates the latter. While selling pressure might ease at any time, historical trends suggest that a true reversal requires at least six months, making a short-term rebound unlikely.",04-05-2025

Binance,"Understanding PSIP: A Key Indicator of Market Sentiment
According to BlockBeats, the Percent Supply in Profit (PSIP) is a significant on-chain metric that measures the proportion of circulating Bitcoin ($BTC) that is in a profitable state. This indicator is calculated by comparing the last transfer price of each $BTC with its current price. If the current price exceeds the last transfer price, the $BTC is considered to be in profit. PSIP serves as a guide to market sentiment and has applications in both identifying market tops and bottoms. When the majority of $BTC holdings are at a loss, it often signals a good buying opportunity, as fewer holders are likely to sell at a loss, reducing selling pressure. Conversely, when most holdings are profitable, the market may experience increased selling pressure as holders look to realize gains. Historically, Bitcoin has shown precise bottoming signals when PSIP falls below 50%, indicating a potential buying opportunity. However, a high PSIP alone does not necessarily indicate a market top, as the maximum value of profitable holdings can reach 100%. An interesting approach is to observe the correlation between PSIP and price changes, which can provide insights into market dynamics. This concept is further explored in analyses such as 'The Market Pulse – Week 36, 2022.' For those interested in delving deeper into on-chain data analysis, following this series of articles is recommended.

As traditional markets suffered their worst two-day loss in history, Bitcoin remained remarkably resilient — reinforcing its growing status as a hedge against macroeconomic instability. Over $5 trillion was wiped off the S&P 500 following U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs, yet Bitcoin dipped just 3.7%, maintaining its crucial $82,000 support.Stocks See Record Decline — Bitcoin Defies the TrendAccording to an April 5 Reuters report, the S&P 500's $5 trillion loss exceeded even the historic $3.3 trillion crash during the March 2020 COVID-19 panic. The catalyst? Trump’s April 2 executive order imposing tariffs on all imports, aimed at slashing the U.S. trade deficit and boosting domestic production.In stark contrast, Bitcoin's modest pullback has raised eyebrows across the financial world.“We’re potentially witnessing an evolution in Bitcoin’s market positioning,” said Marcin Kazmierczak, COO of RedStone.“This divergence might signal an emerging perception shift among investors.”Bitcoin: From Risk Asset to Digital Gold?Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) has tracked traditional risk assets like stocks during global shocks. But analysts say that dynamic is changing:BTC only fell 3.7% over the two-day equity market carnage.It held firm above $82,000, showing structural demand even amid forced selling.Meanwhile, major equities collapsed — Tesla (-10.42%), Apple (-7.29%), and Nvidia (-7.36%).“Bitcoin’s fixed supply contrasts sharply with fiat currencies that risk inflation under tariff-driven policies,” added Kazmierczak.Experts Say BTC’s Upside Still IntactDespite short-term uncertainty, industry experts remain bullish for Bitcoin in 2025:Nexo analyst Iliya Kalchev noted that BTC’s ability to hold firm “shows its worth” during macroeconomic stress.DFG CEO James Wo believes Bitcoin’s ETF-driven institutional exposure now makes it more reactive to global trends, but also more resilient.Real Vision’s Jamie Coutts projects that growing M2 money supply could push Bitcoin to $132,000 before the end of 2025.“If Bitcoin can stay resilient through Trump’s trade war, it will further validate its ‘digital gold’ narrative,” Wo told Cointelegraph.Bottom LineAs investors grapple with escalating trade tensions and historic stock market volatility, Bitcoin’s relative stability may signal a turning point in how the asset is perceived. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could solidify its role not just as a speculative asset — but as a reliable store of value in turbulent times, according to Cointelegraph.",04-05-2025

At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $83,749, down just 0.16% over the past week, per CoinMarketCap.This divergence is prompting even crypto skeptics to take notice.“I’ve hated on Bitcoin in the past, but seeing it not tank while the stock market does is very interesting to me,” said Dividend Hero, a popular stock market analyst on X.Technical analyst Urkel added that Bitcoin “doesn’t appear to care one bit about tariff wars and markets tanking.”Market OutlookWhile equities struggle under the weight of recession fears and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin’s resilience is sparking renewed interest from both institutional and retail investors. Some analysts suggest that crypto may be regaining its narrative as a hedge against macroeconomic instability — especially as traditional markets buckle.With tariff escalation, inflation concerns, and potential Federal Reserve rate changes on the horizon, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can sustain its strength — or become the next safe-haven asset in a fractured global economy, according to Cointelegraph.",04-05-2025
Binance,"Crypto Market Funding Rates Indicate Neutral Sentiment
According to BlockBeats, data from Coinglass reveals that the funding rates on major centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEX and DEX) indicate a neutral sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. The market is neither predominantly bearish nor bullish at this time. Funding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain a balance between contract prices and the prices of underlying assets, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the trading platform collecting these fees. The purpose is to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts, ensuring that contract prices remain close to the underlying asset prices. A funding rate of 0.01% is considered the baseline. When the rate exceeds 0.01%, it suggests a bullish market sentiment. Conversely, a rate below 0.005% indicates a bearish outlook.",04-05-2025

Binance,"Understanding Bitcoin's URPD Indicator for Market Analysis
According to BlockBeats, the article explores the URPD indicator, a tool used in on-chain data analysis to understand Bitcoin's price distribution across different holding costs. URPD, or UTXO Realized Price Distribution, leverages Bitcoin's unique blockchain structure to provide insights unavailable in traditional financial markets. This indicator allows analysts to observe the distribution of Bitcoin holdings at various price levels, effectively showing the purchase cost of each Bitcoin. The URPD indicator is instrumental in analyzing the turnover, accumulation, and distribution of Bitcoin holdings. By examining daily changes in URPD, analysts can track how Bitcoin chips are exchanged at different price levels. For instance, comparing URPD charts from May 1 and October 1 reveals a noticeable distribution of low-cost chips following a period of price fluctuation. Historically, significant distribution of low-cost, high-profit chips occurs near market tops, while accumulation happens in narrower ranges at market bottoms. URPD can be used alongside other data, such as realized profits and MVRV, to gain a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. When a large number of chips accumulate within a specific price range, it indicates a growing consensus in supply and demand. If prices rise sharply beyond this range, the accumulated chips may provide future support. Conversely, if prices fall below this range, the chips may become trapped, potentially acting as resistance during future price increases. The article concludes by encouraging readers interested in on-chain data analysis to follow the series for deeper insights. It also invites readers to follow the author's social media for more educational content on on-chain data analysis.",04-04-2025
Binance,"SEC Clarifies Jurisdiction Limits on Stablecoins Amid Regulatory Shifts
According to CoinDesk, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified its stance on certain stablecoins, stating that it does not have jurisdiction over these digital assets or their issuers. This announcement is part of a broader effort by the SEC, under the leadership appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump, to delineate areas of the crypto sector that fall outside its regulatory scope. The agency's Crypto Task Force has been instrumental in easing regulatory pressures on digital assets, previously identifying memecoins and proof-of-work crypto mining as outside its purview. The latest statement from the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance, issued on Friday, asserts that certain stablecoins do not constitute securities and therefore do not require registration under the Securities Act. The statement specifies that transactions involving the minting and redeeming of these stablecoins do not need to be registered with the SEC, as they are intended for use in commerce, payments, money transmission, and value storage, rather than as investment vehicles. However, the statement's criteria may exclude Tether's USDT, as it notes that acceptable reserves should not include precious metals or other crypto assets, which are part of Tether's reserves. Additionally, the requirement for tokens to be redeemable for dollars at any time may conflict with Tether's terms of service, which suggest potential restrictions. Congress is actively working on establishing new standards for stablecoin issuance, with the House Financial Services Committee advancing a bill towards a vote in the House of Representatives. The Senate is also considering a similar bill, both receiving bipartisan support. Despite their stable nature, stablecoins have become a contentious political issue, with the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial proposing its own stablecoin, and concerns from some congressional Democrats about Elon Musk's potential involvement in the sector. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, leading the agency's task force, emphasizes the importance of these preliminary, nonbinding actions to reduce crypto resistance at the SEC, suggesting that non-fungible tokens (NFTs) may also be considered for similar statements. The SEC is preparing for its second crypto summit next week, focusing on trading. The agency may soon see a leadership change if Trump's nominee for permanent chairman, Paul Atkins, is confirmed by the Senate. Interim Chairman Mark Uyeda has already initiated significant changes to the SEC's approach to crypto regulation, including dismissing several enforcement cases against digital asset businesses, although some cases remain active.",04-04-2025

Binance,"Stablecoin Legislation: A Crucial Decision for U.S. Financial Dominance
According to CoinDesk, the evolution of communication technology in the early 1990s, marked by the shift to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), drastically reduced the cost of long-distance calls. This transformation is mirrored today in the financial sector, where the emergence of a global, embedded financial layer within the internet is driving money transfer costs towards zero. This shift is largely attributed to the rise of stablecoins, which have seen explosive growth in recent years. In 2024, stablecoin transaction volumes exceeded $27 trillion, surpassing the combined volumes of Visa and Mastercard. Providers like Tether now hold more U.S. Treasuries than some countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. Stablecoins are increasingly integrated into the global financial ecosystem, prompting U.S. lawmakers to consider legislation that could reinforce the dollar's status as the global reserve currency. The debate centers around two potential paths: a closed-market approach favoring U.S.-based stablecoin issuers, or a regulatory framework that encourages global competition. The latter approach would allow international players like Tether to compete alongside U.S. issuers, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where innovation thrives. Contrary to some beliefs, responsible stablecoin issuers exist both inside and outside the U.S., with Tether assisting law enforcement agencies worldwide in blocking illicit activities. The decision Congress faces is critical. Overly restrictive regulation could drive foreign-based companies out of the U.S., diminishing demand for U.S. Treasuries and weakening the dollar's dominance. This moment presents an opportunity to craft a regulatory framework that champions competition and transparency, rather than adopting a protectionist stance that could stifle innovation. The diversity of the market should be seen as a feature to harness, not a problem to fix. As the stakes are high, it is imperative to make a careful choice to ensure the future of finance is secure and prosperous.",04-04-2025

Binance,"Survey Shows Growing Interest in Cryptocurrency Investment Among Americans
According to ShibDaily, a recent survey conducted by the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) reveals that over half of Americans are keen on using cryptocurrency for investment purposes. The 2025 State of Crypto Holders Report highlights this trend, indicating that 52% of crypto owners are primarily interested in leveraging digital assets to enhance their financial futures over the next two to three years. This optimism is reflected in the positive impact cryptocurrency has had on their lives, with 44% of respondents reporting a sense of achievement from investment gains and 42% appreciating the diversification it brings to their portfolios. The survey further notes that 60% of participants cite financial investment as their main motivation for exploring cryptocurrency, while curiosity about the technology itself ranks closely behind, with 50% expressing interest in learning more. Despite the enthusiasm for digital assets, concerns persist, as approximately 32% of crypto holders report experiencing stress or anxiety related to managing their investments. Many admit gaps in their knowledge, with 81% expressing a desire to learn more about cryptocurrency. To satisfy this curiosity, 40% of respondents seek crypto news daily, with interests spanning investment strategies, legal and regulatory issues, security measures, and tax implications. The World Economic Forum’s Global Retail Investor Outlook 2024, released on March 26, highlights an interesting trend in cryptocurrency investment among younger demographics. The report, which surveyed 13,000 individuals from 13 different countries, indicates that 62% of Millennials have invested at least a third of their portfolios in cryptocurrencies. Gen Z individuals are even more heavily invested, with 35% putting over half of their portfolios in digital assets. This data shows a notable increase in the proportion of younger investors engaging with digital currencies. The report highlights that 30% of Gen Z individuals begin investing in their early adulthood, contrasting with only 9% of Gen X and 6% of Baby Boomers. By the time they enter the workforce, 86% of Gen Z are already familiar with personal investing, compared to just 47% of Baby Boomers. The driving forces behind this trend appear to be technological accessibility, growing trust in blockchain principles, and the influence of social media and digital learning platforms. As cryptocurrency gains popularity as an investment vehicle, it is crucial for individuals to remain cautious. The volatile nature of digital assets requires careful consideration and education. Informed decisions can help investors mitigate risks and achieve more successful investment outcomes.",04-04-2025

Binance,"Market Strategies Suggested Amid Potential Economic Shifts
According to BlockBeats, Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has outlined potential market strategies in response to fluctuations in stocks, oil prices, bond yields, and the U.S. dollar. Hartnett suggests that while these factors might encourage market risk appetite, a weak employment market or increased fiscal policy uncertainty could negatively impact asset prices. Hartnett has identified three distinct ranges for the S&P 500 index, recommending different investment strategies based on these levels. If the S&P 500 reaches 5400 and the dollar weakens, he advises investing in emerging markets and real estate investment trusts (REITs). At the 5100-5200 level, he recommends purchasing small-cap stocks, homebuilders, and Asian tech stocks, which are sensitive to policy changes. Should the S&P 500 fall to the 4800-5000 range and U.S. President Donald Trump's approval rating drops to 40-45%, Hartnett suggests aggressively increasing positions in risk assets.",04-04-2025

Binance,"House Committee Approves CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act Amid Privacy Concerns
According to ShibDaily, the House Committee on Financial Services, chaired by French Hill (AR-02), has approved the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act along with other significant legislation during a full committee markup session. The CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act narrowly passed with a 27-22 vote, aiming to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar due to concerns over financial surveillance and the central bank's potential role as a retail banking entity. The bill prohibits the Federal Reserve System from deploying a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) through intermediaries and restricts the use of digital currency for monetary policy purposes. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), the bill's sponsor, emphasized the importance of avoiding government involvement in financial surveillance tools, contrasting decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with CBDCs, which are managed by central banks. Emmer stated that a CBDC could become government-controlled programmable money, potentially allowing the federal government to surveil Americans' transactions and restrict politically unpopular activities. During the markup session, other key legislation, including the STABLE Act, the 1071 Repeal to Protect Small Business Lending Act, and the Promoting New Bank Formation Act, also received approval. Rep. Bryan Steil, who sponsored the STABLE Act, highlighted the bill's role in shaping future digital asset regulations and safeguarding the financial system's integrity. He noted that the bill establishes a comprehensive framework for the issuance and operation of dollar-denominated payment stablecoins in the United States, addressing the fragmented regulatory environment businesses currently face. The bill imposes strict reserve requirements to ensure stability and consumer protection. The approval of the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act by the House Committee reflects lawmakers' hesitance toward Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Legislators have expressed concerns that CBDCs could undermine the financial system and infringe on individual privacy. Critics argue that a government-controlled digital currency may lead to increased surveillance and a loss of consumer choice, potentially disrupting the balance of power in the banking sector. Some fear that a central digital currency may diminish competition and ultimately harm consumers.

Binance,"Stablecoin Supply Surges Amid Market Uncertainty and Tariff Concerns
According to Cointelegraph, the stablecoin supply experienced a significant increase of over $30 billion in the first quarter of 2025, reaching new record levels. This surge occurred despite a 19% decline in the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization. The rise in stablecoin supply reflects a cautious approach by investors who are holding stablecoins as a hedge, likely waiting for market stability or more favorable entry points. The correlation between cryptocurrencies and stocks has intensified as macroeconomic expectations shifted from optimism to concerns over U.S. tariffs. Industry experts predict that the stablecoin supply could exceed $1 trillion in 2025, potentially serving as a major catalyst for the cryptocurrency market. During a live show on Cointelegraph's Chainreaction, Pakman highlighted the potential for stablecoin adoption to increase dramatically this year, suggesting that the supply could grow from $225 billion to $1 trillion within the calendar year. On March 15, the stablecoin supply surpassed the previous record high of $219 billion, with analysts viewing this growth as a positive indicator for the continuation of the bull cycle. The Ethereum network has seen a substantial increase in stablecoin activity, with over $3 trillion worth of transactions on the mainnet during the first quarter of the year. The number of unique addresses using stablecoins on Ethereum's mainnet also reached a record high, surpassing 200,000 for the first time in March. Despite this increased blockchain activity, the price of Ether (ETH) fell by over 45% during the same period. This decline is attributed to a combination of broader macroeconomic concerns and specific pressures on Ethereum, such as competition from networks like Solana and the rise of layer-2 protocols. Some analysts argue that layer-2 solutions may dilute ETH's value by shifting activity off the main chain. However, Juan Pellicer, a senior research analyst at IntoTheBlock, points out that these solutions still rely on Ethereum for security and contribute to its ecosystem by paying fees. He suggests that the decline in ETH is more likely due to market sentiment and uncertainty about Ethereum's ability to capture value from its broader ecosystem. Meanwhile, other analysts see potential positive outcomes from tariff-related investor concerns, with Nansen analysts predicting a 70% chance for crypto markets to bottom by June 2025 as tariff negotiations progress.",04-04-2025

According to ShibDaily, Deel Inc., a human resources software company, is embroiled in allegations of corporate espionage following claims that a former employee of competitor Rippling confessed to spying under the direction of Deel’s CEO, Alex Bouaziz. An affidavit unsealed in an Irish court reveals that Keith O’Brien, the ex-employee, admitted to receiving approximately €5,000 monthly for sharing confidential information about Rippling, including corporate strategies, customer insights, and internal communications. O’Brien reportedly stated that Bouaziz encouraged him to remain at Rippling and act as an informant, likening the role to that of a spy akin to “James Bond.” Payments were allegedly coordinated through Deel CFO Philippe Bouaziz and often made using cryptocurrency. Rippling discovered the espionage scheme after observing unusual activities, such as Deel’s aggressive recruitment of its employees and inquiries from journalists about internal discussions. Security teams initiated an investigation, creating a fake Slack channel as a “honeypot” to verify suspicions. Shortly thereafter, O’Brien accessed the decoy channel, providing evidence of unauthorized surveillance. Legal proceedings intensified when Rippling obtained a court order to search O’Brien’s devices. He subsequently admitted to resetting and destroying his phone on the advice of Deel’s legal team and was urged to relocate to Dubai for safety.

Binance,"FBI Recovers Millions in Heartland Tri-State Bank Cryptocurrency Fraud Case
According to ShibDaily, the FBI has successfully recovered $8.2 million stolen in a cryptocurrency scheme that led to the collapse of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas. This recovery comes nearly a year after the fraudulent activities were uncovered, providing relief to local shareholders who suffered significant losses. The bank's former CEO, Shan Hanes, was sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2024 for siphoning $47 million into a crypto investment scam. While customer deposits were federally insured, approximately 30 shareholders, including farmers and small-business owners, lost their life savings when the bank failed. Investigators managed to trace the stolen funds to an offshore cryptocurrency wallet and seized them, marking a rare success in digital financial crime recovery. The return of the funds was a significant moment for the victims, who learned at a federal restitution hearing in November that most of their losses would be restored. Emilee Thompson, a forfeiture specialist with the FBI’s Kansas City office, emphasized the impact of returning the money to the victims, stating, ""To be able to give them back their money is extremely powerful."" Special Agent Sage Hemmert, who led the investigation, described the emotional response from the victims, noting that there was cheering, clapping, and crying during the hearing. This case underscores the growing threat of cryptocurrency fraud, which resulted in $5.6 billion in reported losses in 2023, according to the FBI's press release. It also highlights law enforcement's increasing capability to track illicit digital transactions, setting a precedent for future financial crime investigations.",04-04-2025
Binance,"Altcoin News: Analyst Predicts One Last Altcoin Rally — But Only a Select Few Will Benefit
As the crypto market hovers in a state of uncertainty, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts believes altcoins still have one more rally left this cycle. However, only those with strong utility and rising network activity are likely to benefit.Altcoins Could See a Final Surge by JuneIn an April 3 livestream with Real Vision co-founder Raoul Pal, Coutts forecasted a potential altcoin breadth thrust by June, contingent on Bitcoin returning to all-time highs.“There will be one more thrust from altcoins,” Coutts said. “The question is whether it’s a sustained six- to twelve-month rally.”The analyst emphasized that network activity is the “north star” for traders navigating altcoin markets. Rather than speculating across the board, investors should monitor where on-chain user activity is concentrating. Quality Altcoins Over QuantityWhile there are over 36 million altcoins in existence, Ethereum continues to dominate the landscape, holding 55.56% of total value locked (TVL), according to CoinGecko. It’s followed by Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and Tron — each with under 7% market share.Coutts warned that not all altcoins will participate in the next upswing. Only “quality names” with real use cases and network traction are poised to see gains.“Activity drives prices,” he noted, highlighting that utility, not hype, will lead the next wave.Altcoin Metrics Signal Bearish SentimentDespite the hopeful outlook, several altcoin market indicators continue to flash bearish signals:Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index dropped to 12%, plunging 53% since late December.CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index scored a 14 out of 100, signaling the market is firmly in “Bitcoin Season.”Bitcoin dominance remains high at 62.84%, historically a level that precedes altcoin retracements, though some experts say it’s no longer a reliable signal.According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, trading volume — not BTC dominance — is the new indicator for altseason readiness.If Bitcoin reclaims its all-time highs by Q2's end, altcoins could see a sharp, final rally — but only a select few will rise. Traders should look past speculation and focus on blockchain network activity, user engagement, and product-market fit when selecting altcoins in this maturing market cycle, according to Cointelegraph.",04-04-2025
Binance,"EU Reportedly Weighs $1B Fine Against Elon Musk’s X Over Digital Services Act Violations
The European Union is reportedly preparing to levy a $1 billion fine against Elon Musk’s social media platform X (formerly Twitter), citing violations of the Digital Services Act (DSA) related to illicit content, hate speech, and disinformation. The fine could potentially factor in revenue from Musk’s broader business empire, including Tesla and SpaceX, according to an April 3 report by The New York Times.What You Need to Know:Fine amount: Up to $1 billion, with calculations potentially including revenue from Musk's other companies.Law cited: The EU’s Digital Services Act, which allows fines of up to 6% of a company’s global revenue for non-compliance.Allegations: X has failed to adequately police harmful content, refused data access to researchers, and lacked transparency in advertising and account verification practices.Investigations: The platform is reportedly under two separate probes, both of which could result in substantial penalties or product restrictions.X Pushes Back, Calls Fine “Political Censorship”In response, X’s Global Government Affairs team issued a statement condemning the move as “an unprecedented act of political censorship and an attack on free speech.” The team also said:“X has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe.”The company has disputed earlier regulatory findings in hundreds of points, arguing that it has complied with EU requirements. Elon Musk has previously accused EU regulators of proposing backroom deals involving secret content suppression in exchange for avoiding penalties—a claim firmly denied by EU officials.Possible Settlement and Future PenaltiesWhile a final ruling has yet to be issued, The New York Times reports that EU officials may still offer a settlement path, requiring X to implement product changes that meet regulatory standards. A second investigation into the platform’s handling of hate speech and disinformation could also result in additional fines or restrictions.The DSA, enacted in October 2022, holds large digital platforms accountable for content moderation, transparency, and user safety, and grants the EU new powers to enforce compliance.What’s Next?The EU is expected to announce the full scope of any penalties in the coming months, though the situation remains fluid. Musk has said he is prepared to fight the decision in court, declaring:“I look forward to a very public battle in court so that the people of Europe can know the truth.”As regulatory pressure ramps up, the case could have broad implications for free speech, platform responsibility, and the enforcement power of global digital governance, according to Cointelegraph.",04-04-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin News Today: Arthur Hayes Backs Trump Tariffs as a Bullish Trigger for Bitcoin Price
BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs could disrupt global markets — but that may be just what Bitcoin needs to soar.In an April 3 post on X, Hayes enthusiastically declared his support for the new tariff policy, writing, “Some of y’all are running scurred, but I LOVE TARIFFS.” He believes the resulting economic strain will be met with monetary stimulus, which historically benefits Bitcoin. Tariffs Could Trigger Printed Money—and a Bitcoin BoomAccording to Hayes, Trump's global tariff plan — which includes a 10% blanket tariff on all imports starting April 5, and even harsher rates for China (34%), the European Union (20%), and Japan (24%) — will correct “global imbalances.”“The pain [will be] papered over with printed money, which is good for BTC,” Hayes said, arguing that the inevitable monetary easing will serve as fuel for the next crypto bull run.How Tariffs Could Drive BTC HigherHayes outlines multiple factors that could make the current economic environment favorable for Bitcoin:Weakening U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): As global investors sell off U.S. equities and repatriate funds, the DXY could fall, boosting demand for alternative assets like Bitcoin.Fed Rate Cuts & QE: Hayes noted a sharp drop in the two-year Treasury yield after the tariff announcement, signaling expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and potentially a return to quantitative easing (QE).Weaker Chinese Yuan: With China now facing a 65% effective tariff, Hayes predicts that Beijing may let the yuan (CNY) weaken past 8.00, pushing Chinese investors to seek hedges like Bitcoin to preserve wealth. Market Volatility Creates OpportunityApril 3 saw a historic drop in traditional markets. The Nasdaq 100 posted its largest single-day point loss ever, shedding 1,060 points — nearly triggering a circuit breaker for the first time since the 2020 COVID crash, according to The Kobeissi Letter.“This is good for BTC and gold over the medium term,” Hayes asserted.Experts Agree: Bitcoin Set to BenefitHayes isn’t alone. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, previously predicted in February that Trump’s trade war would ultimately drive BTC “violently higher.”“In a world of weaker dollar and weaker U.S. rates… risk assets in the U.S. will fly through the roof beyond your wildest imagination,” Park said.Bitcoin Positioned to Thrive Amid Trade TurmoilAs macroeconomic uncertainty intensifies and policymakers weigh rate cuts to soften the impact of Trump’s tariff strategy, Arthur Hayes and others believe Bitcoin stands to benefit from rising liquidity, weakening fiat currencies, and global investor unease.If history repeats, this could mark the beginning of a powerful new leg in Bitcoin’s bull market — driven not by hype, but by policy and capital rotation, according to Cointelegraph.",04-04-2025

Binance,"OTC Weekly Trading Insights (04/04/2025)
Top Interest of the WeekPAX Gold ($PAXG) is a stablecoin backed by physical gold, issued by Paxos. Amid the heightened uncertainty stemming from the global trade war, investors turned to PAXG tokens to gain exposure to gold. Despite a downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market due to increased risks, PAXG achieved a new all-time high of $3,195 on exchanges, while the PAXG/BTC trading pair also hit a four-month peak. This surge was driven by robust demand for this safe-haven asset within the crypto space for tactical portfolio allocation.First Digital USD ($FDUSD), a USD-pegged stablecoin issued by First Digital Trust, encountered negative sentiment when Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, alleged that the issuer was effectively insolvent and unable to return funds to customers. Following Sun's initial post on X, the price of $FDUSD plummeted to $0.8726 USDT. However, it gradually recovered to 0.99 USDT after the issuer addressed the allegations. Both parties held press conferences, which helped restore market confidence, leading to $FDUSD trading around the 0.9950 USDT mark.Overall MarketSource: TradingViewThe above chart is the BTC price in the daily candle chart at the log scale.Our analysis from the previous week suggested that Bitcoin's price is expected to fluctuate between $80,000 and $90,000. We also raised concerns regarding the impending reciprocal tariffs introduced by President Trump.Last Friday, the core PCE price index exceeded expectations, leading to market concerns about the Federal Reserve's strategy for interest rate cuts in 2025. With persistent inflation in the US and the potential effects of tariffs on prices, the market has reduced the probability of a shift towards a more accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve this year. While tariffs may also affect consumer spending and indirectly decrease demand for goods and services, potentially leading to a reduction in inflation, the numerous variables involved make it difficult to ascertain the extent of their negative impact on inflation.On Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin ($BTC) experienced a remarkable surge, surpassing the $89,000 mark following President Trump's announcement that universal tariffs would be set at 10% instead of the previously proposed 20%. However, this upward momentum was short-lived as the market quickly reversed direction after additional information regarding reciprocal tariffs came to light. Following the press conference, BTC experienced a sharp decline, dropping below $83,000, which coincided with a more than 2% decrease in the S&P 500 index after market close.Our analysis suggests that the market's initial reaction to the decline in risk assets was expected. We anticipate that this downward trend will continue for an extended period as other countries develop their responses to the tariffs imposed by the United States.Historically, the United States has employed tariffs to shield domestic industries from foreign competition, a strategy prominently utilized during the early years of the Great Depression. A defining example is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which dramatically increased tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods. Signed into law by President Herbert Hoover, this legislation aimed to protect American farmers and manufacturers struggling amid the economic downturn that began with the stock market crash of 1929. However, the policy backfired spectacularly. Rather than bolstering the U.S. economy, it provoked swift retaliation from 25 trading partners, including Canada and several European nations, who imposed their own tariffs on American goods. This tit-for-tat escalation triggered a severe contraction in international trade, with global trade plummeting by approximately 66% between 1929 and 1934. According to our analysis, we expect that other nations will initially respond to the newly imposed U.S. tariffs by implementing their own tariffs on American products. This is likely to initiate a negotiation phase between the United States and these countries. Through this process, the U.S. has the opportunity to redefine the global trade landscape and enhance its position within it. If negotiations proceed favorably and the U.S. secures its objectives, we anticipate a shift in market sentiment towards a more risk-on attitude. However, this process may take several months and could potentially reverse. Currently, our outlook remains bearish for the near term, with a shift to a bullish stance anticipated only after the Federal Reserve intervenes and announces interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy.Macro at a glance Last Thursday (25-03-27)In the fourth quarter of 2024, core PCE prices in the United States increased by 2.6%, which is slightly below the anticipated 2.7% but an increase from the 2.2% recorded in the third quarter. The Federal Reserve implemented a 50 basis point rate cut last September, followed by two rate cuts of 25 basis points each after.The US GDP experienced a quarterly growth of 2.4% in Q4 of last year, surpassing the expected growth rate of 2.3%.Initial jobless claims in the US continue to remain low, with a report of 224,000 claims last week.Last Friday (25-03-28)UK GDP experienced a quarterly growth of 0.1% in the last quarter, aligning with market forecasts. The annual growth rate increased to 1.5% in Q4, up from 0.9% in Q3.In the US, the PCE price index recorded a year-over-year increase of 2.5% in February, meeting market expectations. However, the core PCE price index rose by 2.8% annually, surpassing the anticipated 2.7%. This indicates that inflation in the US remains persistent, suggesting that the Federal Reserve is likely to maintain the current interest rate for an extended period while awaiting a decline in inflation towards its 2% target.On Monday (25-03-31)China's manufacturing PMI for March was reported at 50.5, surpassing the anticipated 50.4 and February's figure of 50.2. Despite the challenges posed by US tariffs on Chinese exports, the manufacturing PMI indicates that the Chinese economy is experiencing a phase of expansion.On Tuesday (25-04-01)The Reserve Bank of Australia has maintained its interest rate at 4.1%, unchanged. Governor Bullock indicated that the central bank is prepared to take action in response to the uncertainties stemming from the escalated trade war. In the Eurozone, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is anticipated to show an annual increase of 2.2% in March, while core CPI is expected to rise by 2.4% annually. This inflation data implies that the European Union is in a better position than the Federal Reserve in achieving the 2% inflation target, potentially enabling the European Central Bank to implement monetary policy adjustments more swiftly.In the United States, job openings reported in the JOLTS survey decreased from 7.762 million in January to 7.568 million in February, falling short of the market forecast of 7.690 million.On Wednesday (25-04-02)The US ADP nonfarm employment report indicates that 155,000 new jobs were created in March, surpassing the anticipated 118,000. President Donald Trump announced that the US will implement a 10% universal tariff on all imports beginning April 5. This initial rate will be succeeded by higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% on goods from 60 countries starting April 9.Initially, the risk market experienced a surge following the announcement of the 10% universal tariff, as expectations had been set for a 20% tariff. However, once the specifics of the reciprocal tariffs were revealed, all risk assets plummeted. Bitcoin fell to $82,500, while Ethereum dropped below the $1,800 mark.Convert Portal Volume ChangeThe above table shows the volume change on our Convert Portal by zone. Last week, the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index surpassed market expectations, raising concerns among investors about the Federal Reserve's potential tightening of monetary policy. The tariffs imposed by the US government have sparked forecasts of a rising inflation rate in the near future. Following the release of the unexpectedly high core PCE price index last Friday, risk assets faced a downturn. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron ($TRX), took to social media to assert that First Digital Trust, a stablecoin issuer, was essentially insolvent, which played a role in the de-pegging of $FDUSD.In the Other sector, robust demand for trading led to a 13.7% increase in trading volume, primarily driven by heightened interest in FUNToken ($FUN) and the stablecoin First Digital USD ($FDUSD).In the Payments sector, trading volume rose by 8.5% last week, largely propelled by market enthusiasm for Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ripple ($XRP).In the Proof of Work (POW) sector, trading volume experienced a 4.1% increase, primarily attributed to the demand for Bitcoin ($BTC).Why trade OTC?

Binance,"Crypto Market Shows Bearish Trend as Funding Rates Decline
According to BlockBeats, recent data from Coinglass indicates that funding rates across major centralized and decentralized exchanges suggest a bearish outlook for the cryptocurrency market. The funding rates for key cryptocurrencies are detailed in the accompanying data. Funding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain a balance between contract prices and the prices of underlying assets, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the platform collecting these fees. It serves to adjust the cost or yield of holding contracts, ensuring that contract prices remain close to the prices of the underlying assets. A funding rate of 0.01% is considered the baseline. When the funding rate exceeds 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market sentiment. Conversely, when the funding rate falls below 0.005%, it reflects a predominantly bearish market sentiment.",04-04-2025
Binance,"Solana News: Solana's SOL Token Faces Potential Price Volatility Amid U.S. Payroll Report
According to CoinDesk, Solana's SOL token is anticipated to experience a price fluctuation of nearly 6% following significant sell-offs by large investors, commonly referred to as whales, ahead of the U.S. non-farm payroll (NFP) report expected later today. This prediction is based on Volmex's one-day implied volatility index (IV) for SOL, which currently indicates an annualized reading of 109.70%. This suggests an expected 24-hour price volatility of 5.74%. Such a movement is considered moderate, especially given that the cryptocurrency has seen several days of 6% or higher volatility since early March.Data from blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain reveals that several whales have unstaked and sold SOL worth $46.3 million in the market. Typically, large-scale selling by whales can lead to bearish price movements. However, the amount sold today represents only 0.97% of the cryptocurrency's 24-hour trading volume of $4.7 billion. As a result, SOL is trading relatively unchanged at approximately $116, after hitting a low of $112 on Thursday. Overall, the cryptocurrency has been in a downward trend since reaching a peak of $295 on January 19.Attention is now focused on the upcoming U.S. jobs data, scheduled for release at 12:30 GMT. The report is expected to show that the economy added 130,000 jobs in March, a slowdown from February's 151,000 and significantly below the 12-month average of 162,300, according to FactSet. The median estimate for the unemployment rate in March is 4.2%, the highest since November, and up from February's 4.1%. Average hourly earnings are projected to have increased by 0.3% month-on-month, consistent with February's growth rate. A weaker-than-expected jobs report could support renewed expectations for four 25-basis-point interest-rate cuts this year, potentially boosting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.",04-04-2025

This makes lisUSD stable, yield-generating, and DeFi-native, unlike traditional CDPs.What advancements can users expect in the BNBFi ecosystem?Terry:We’re making BNBFi more powerful and inclusive:Stake BNB → Borrow lisUSD → Farm Launchpool automatically.Bridge to Binance rewards with assets like BTC via clisBNB.Introduce looping strategies to boost APR.Our mission is to break down entry barriers and increase yield access across BNBFi.What key partnerships are accelerating Lista DAO's growth in 2025? ﻿Terry:Two critical collaborations are pushing us forward:Pendle Finance: Users can tokenize and trade future yields.Solv Protocol: BTC holders can farm Launchpool rewards without selling their Bitcoin.These partnerships boost accessibility, yield optimization, and BNBFi adoption.What are the biggest challenges ahead for Lista DAO?Terry:We're focused on solving:Regulatory uncertainty, while keeping decentralization intact.Increasing liquid staking adoption across the BNB Chain.Expanding lisUSD’s use cases to build demand.Cross-chain expansion, partnerships, and community support will help us overcome these.If you could describe Lista DAO’s ultimate vision in one sentence, what would it be?Terry:“All in BNBFi.”What DeFi problem does Lista DAO solve that no one else has addressed?Terry:We offer multi-layered yield without making users swap into unfamiliar tokens. Plus, we're BNB-native, unlike most DeFi platforms that only focus on ETH.Lista DAO is the first truly BNBFi-native yield platform with complete vertical integration on BNB Chain.How important is community governance in shaping Lista DAO’s future?Terry:Our governance is community-led via veLISTA holders. They control:Emissions and protocol incentivesStrategic development directions This aligns protocol growth with user interests and ensures long-term decentralization.What sets Lista DAO apart from competitors like Lido or Rocket Pool?Terry:We're deeply integrated with Binance and the only project in Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer airdrops. Plus:Built natively on BNB ChainExclusively aligned with BNBFiOffer access to exclusive Binance DeFi featuresWhat role does Binance play in shaping the future of BNB liquid staking?Terry:Binance is key to our strategy.

According to PANews, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher recently shared insights on the challenges faced by investors in the cryptocurrency sector. Deutscher emphasized that a mindset of 'avoidance' is a significant threat to the industry, revealing that he lost millions during this cycle due to neglecting profit-taking and failing to identify risk signals promptly. Deutscher noted that during favorable market conditions, investors might become complacent due to excitement, while during downturns, they might ignore portfolio management due to avoidance tendencies, missing out on buying opportunities or necessary risk mitigation. He shared a personal example where he anticipated a weakening trend in the U.S. dollar but failed to hedge adequately, resulting in substantial losses in forex trading. Deutscher stressed that actions in investing are more crucial than opinions and advised investors to remain objective, continuously assessing risks and opportunities. Additionally, he mentioned that avoiding the review of a losing portfolio could be a manifestation of avoidance psychology, which exacerbates issues as portfolios require ongoing management. Deutscher believes that unless investors are entirely holding BTC or stablecoins, they should actively monitor market dynamics.",04-04-2025

Binance,"U.S. Employment Data to Influence Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy
According to BlockBeats, the United States is set to release its March non-farm payroll (NFP) data today, which is expected to be a key indicator for the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy decisions. Market expectations suggest that if the data is weak, the Federal Reserve may accelerate interest rate cuts, potentially benefiting the cryptocurrency market. Conversely, strong data could negatively impact risk assets. The anticipated non-farm payroll figure is 139,000, down from the previous 151,000. The unemployment rate is expected to be 4.2%, slightly higher than the previous 4.1%. The average hourly earnings month-on-month growth rate is projected at 0.4%, compared to the previous 0.3%. Analysts from Bitunx advise that a weak employment market will strengthen expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve within the year, enhancing market liquidity and the performance of risk assets. Bitcoin is currently focusing on short-term support at 80,000 and long-term support at 78,000. Recently, the cryptocurrency market has been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and global economic slowdown expectations, leading to increased market volatility.

Binance,"Trump's Aggressive Tariff Plan Sparks Market Concerns
According to BlockBeats, U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpectedly aggressive tariff plan has heightened investor fears of a full-blown trade war potentially leading to an economic recession. On Thursday, major U.S. stock indices experienced significant declines, with the Nasdaq dropping 5.97%, marking its largest single-day fall since March 2020. The S&P 500 fell 4.84%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 3.98%, both experiencing their biggest single-day drops since June 2020. Large technology stocks suffered substantial losses due to anticipated supply chain disruptions from the tariffs, with Apple plummeting over 9%. The combined market value of the 'Magnificent 7' tech giants lost approximately $1 trillion in a day, reaching its lowest point since early August last year. The cryptocurrency market also saw widespread declines. Bitcoin fell from a pre-tariff announcement high of $88,000 to below $81,000, a significant drop but relatively resilient compared to tech stocks. Various market sectors experienced sharp declines, with the overall crypto market capitalization dropping nearly 8%. The crypto fear and greed index, which had shown some recovery in March, returned to the 'extreme fear' range. The forex and commodities markets were similarly affected. The U.S. dollar index fell 1.61% to its lowest level since October 2024, erasing all gains since Trump's election. The prospect of slowing global economic growth caused oil prices to plummet nearly 7%, the largest single-day drop since July 2022. Spot gold prices remained relatively stable, showing little change from the previous trading day. Trump's tariff announcement has caused turmoil in financial markets, with the March non-farm payroll report set to be released tonight. Before the potential impact of import tariffs on the data, the labor market is expected to remain stable. Market attention is focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech.

Binance,"Arthur Hayes Discusses Tariffs and Their Impact on Bitcoin and Gold
According to Odaily, Arthur Hayes recently shared his views on the X platform, highlighting the effects of tariffs on global markets. Hayes noted that while some investors are hastily withdrawing, he sees tariffs as beneficial. He believes that global imbalances will eventually be corrected, and the activation of money printing could alleviate economic pain, which would be advantageous for Bitcoin. Hayes pointed out that tariffs have led to a weakening of the U.S. dollar, prompting foreign investors to sell U.S. tech stocks and repatriate funds. In the medium term, he expects Bitcoin and gold to benefit from these developments. Following the announcement of tariffs, the yield on two-year U.S. Treasury bonds plummeted, signaling an imminent interest rate cut and the potential restart of quantitative easing. Additionally, Hayes mentioned that Japan might need its central bank to release yen liquidity or increase quantitative easing to devalue the yen as a countermeasure to tariffs.

Binance,"Understanding Bitcoin Cost for Long-Term Holders
According to BlockBeats, the concept of Long Term Holder (LTH) in Bitcoin investment is defined by Glassnode as holding BTC for more than 155 days. This article explores the profitability and cost metrics associated with LTHs, specifically focusing on LTH-MVRV and LTH-RP. LTH-RP, or Realized Price for Long Term Holders, represents the average cost of BTC for these investors. It is calculated by dividing the LTH-Realized Cap by the circulating supply. Typically, the LTH-RP is lower than the market's average Realized Price, indicating that long-term holders generally acquire BTC at a lower cost. LTH-MVRV is a metric that reflects the profitability of long-term holders. It is calculated similarly to MVRV, using the formula ""current market value / LTH-Realized Cap"" or ""current market price / LTH-Realized Price."" The fluctuations in LTH-MVRV are often more pronounced than those in MVRV, as long-term holders tend to achieve higher profits. An interesting application of LTH-MVRV is in identifying potential buying opportunities. When LTH-MVRV is less than 1, it indicates that even long-term holders are experiencing losses, suggesting a possible market bottom and a good time to buy. This article is part of a series aimed at educating readers on on-chain data analysis. For those interested in further exploring this topic, following the series is recommended.",04-03-2025
Binance,"EigenLayer to Implement Slashing for Ethereum Restaking Protocol
According to Cointelegraph, EigenLayer is set to introduce slashing for its Ethereum restaking protocol on April 17, marking the protocol's first feature-complete iteration. This development is a significant step towards establishing EigenLayer as a foundational infrastructure for a new generation of verifiable applications and services built on the Verifiable Cloud. The announcement, made on April 2, highlights the protocol's evolution since it began distributing rewards, including its native EIGEN token, to incentivize restakers in 2024. Until now, slashing has been confined to EigenLayer's testnets. The introduction of slashing will allow node operators and restakers to voluntarily opt-in, facilitating a gradual transition for users. EigenLayer, launched in 2023, secures third-party protocols, known as actively validated services (AVSs), using a pool of restaked cryptocurrencies as collateral. Restaking involves using a token already staked with a validator to secure additional protocols simultaneously. Slashing serves as a primary security measure for proof-of-stake protocols, including Ethereum and restaking protocols like EigenLayer, by penalizing node operators for poor performance or misconduct. EigenLayer's blog post on April 3 emphasized that operators who meet the conditions set by AVSs can earn rewards, fostering a marketplace where operators are incentivized for their performance. EigenLayer's ecosystem is expanding, with over 30 AVSs already live on its mainnet and many more in development. Notable AVSs include EigenDA, operated by EigenLayer developer Eigen Labs, and ARPA Network, which specializes in trustless randomization. In October, EigenLayer unlocked its native token, EIGEN, offering a more flexible option for securing consensus-based protocols compared to other proof-of-stake tokens like Ether. The protocol is focusing on onboarding crypto-native applications in sectors such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming before expanding beyond Web3. Founder Sreeram Kannan mentioned in October that EigenLayer is adopting an inside-out approach, initially targeting high-throughput consumer applications like DeFi and gaming, with plans to eventually reach broader consumer markets once a critical mass is achieved.",04-03-2025

According to BlockBeats, the head of the virtual assets department at South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC), Kim Sung-jin, has expressed support for allowing foreign investors to enter the South Korean cryptocurrency market.

Warren criticized Atkins for his role during the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, arguing that his past actions at the SEC were misguided. She also expressed concerns about Gould's previous tenure at the OCC, suggesting that his policies weakened regulatory safeguards and compromised the banking system's stability.

Binance,"Ripple's RLUSD Stablecoin Sees Significant Issuance Amid Growing Demand
According to CoinDesk, over $100 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) has been issued since April 1, marking one of the highest levels in recent months as demand for this relatively new stablecoin intensifies. Earlier this week, a $50 million tranche of RLUSD was issued on Tuesday, followed by another $50 million on Wednesday. This issuance coincides with Ripple's integration of the stablecoin into its official payments product, with payment providers BKK Forex and iSend reportedly already utilizing the stablecoin. Industry experts anticipate that RLUSD could significantly alter the dynamics of the crypto market, potentially challenging established players like tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) with Ripple's offering. The RLUSD stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, is available on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain. It is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents, ensuring its stability. To maintain its peg, RLUSD employs a 1:1 reserve system, where each token corresponds to an equivalent fiat value. Users can mint RLUSD by depositing dollars with authorized partners who issue the tokens, or they can burn RLUSD to redeem cash. Market arbitrage plays a crucial role in stabilizing its price: if RLUSD trades below $1, traders purchase it to redeem at par, thereby increasing demand; conversely, if it trades above $1, more tokens are minted, boosting supply. Security features enhance RLUSD's appeal to institutional users. An amendment to the XRP Ledger in January introduced a ""clawback"" feature, enabling the issuer to reclaim or ""claw back"" certain tokens, such as RLUSD, from users' wallets under specific conditions. This feature is generally implemented for regulatory compliance, allowing the recovery of assets in cases of fraud, illegal activities, or when tokens are sent to unintended addresses. As RLUSD gains traction on various platforms, it is expected to boost demand for the XRP token, particularly among decentralized financial (DeFi) applications based on the XRP Ledger.",04-03-2025

According to CoinDesk, bitcoin whales are beginning to accumulate the cryptocurrency again after a prolonged period of distribution, marking a significant shift in market dynamics. These whales, defined as wallets holding 10,000 BTC or more, are purchasing bitcoin as its price dips to just above $80,000. This buying activity follows bitcoin's surge to a record high of over $109,000. Glassnode data indicates that this is the first time in nearly a year that whales are buying so aggressively, reminiscent of their behavior in August 2024 when bitcoin was priced between $50,000 and $60,000 during the unwinding of the yen carry trade. Whales are often regarded as 'smart money' due to their tendency to buy during significant market corrections and sell when prices are strong. This pattern has been evident over the past eight months. Despite the renewed interest from whales, the broader market sentiment remains bearish, with bitcoin currently down 25% from its all-time high. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score, which evaluates the behavior of various wallet cohorts over a 15-day period, reveals that most other investor groups are still in a distribution phase. The score, which ranges from 0 to 1, indicates accumulation when closer to 1 and distribution when near 0. Currently, the overall market score is just 0.15, highlighting the prevailing selling pressure. This data suggests that while whales are beginning to buy the dip, the general market sentiment continues to be bearish, potentially exerting further downward pressure on bitcoin's price in the short term. The divergence between whale activity and broader market behavior underscores the complexity of the current cryptocurrency landscape, where significant players are positioning themselves for potential future gains while the majority of investors remain cautious.",04-03-2025
Binance,"Understanding Key On-Chain Metrics for Bitcoin Market Analysis
According to BlockBeats, the article explores essential on-chain metrics that provide insights into the Bitcoin market. It introduces the concepts of MVRV, Realized Price, and Realized Cap, which are crucial for understanding market profitability and average costs. Realized Cap, also known as realized market value, is calculated by multiplying each unit of Bitcoin by its price at the last transfer and summing these values. This metric reflects the total cost spent on acquiring Bitcoin in the market. Realized Price (RP) is derived by dividing the Realized Cap by the current circulating supply of Bitcoin. It represents the average cost of Bitcoin across the market. When the market price falls below the RP, it is considered a favorable buying opportunity. MVRV is a ratio that indicates market profitability, calculated by dividing the current market value (MV) by the Realized Cap (RV). It can also be expressed as the market price divided by the Realized Price. An MVRV value of 2 suggests that the market is, on average, 100% profitable. The article concludes by encouraging readers interested in further learning about on-chain data analysis to follow the series for more insights.",04-03-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin Hashrate Surges Amid Network and Price Discrepancy
According to CoinDesk, the Bitcoin blockchain's hashrate is experiencing a significant surge, highlighting a growing disconnect between network activity and the price of its native token, bitcoin (BTC). The hashrate, which measures the computational power needed to mine a block on the Bitcoin blockchain, recently hit an all-time high of 838 exahashes per second (EH/s) on a 14-day moving average. On a 24-hour basis, it spiked to 974 EH/s, marking the second-highest level ever recorded, as per Glassnode data. While short-term measurements can be misleading due to block time variability, longer timeframes provide more reliable insights. In the coming days, Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment, which recalibrates every 2016 blocks to maintain a 10-minute block interval, is expected to increase by over 3%, reaching a new peak. This divergence between the hashrate and bitcoin's price is noteworthy, as the cryptocurrency remains about 25% below its all-time high. Meanwhile, mining costs continue to rise, necessitating a strong bitcoin price, full blocks, and high transaction fees for miners to remain profitable and cover operational expenses and capital expenditures. Miners currently earn revenue through block rewards, which stand at 3.125 BTC per block in the current epoch, and transaction fees. However, transaction fees are notably low, averaging around 4 BTC per day, or approximately $377,634. As bitcoin's block subsidy continues to halve every four years, sustained or increasing transaction activity will be crucial to maintaining mining incentives. Recently, developer Mononaut from Mempool observed that Foundry USA Pool mined the emptiest ""non-empty"" block in over two years, containing just seven transactions. This rarity was only surpassed by a block with four transactions back in January 2023. The rising hashrate suggests a booming network, yet the near-empty blocks present a scenario akin to a powerful train speeding down the tracks without passengers. This situation raises concerns for Nicolas Gregory, creator of the Mercury Layer and a former Nasdaq Board Director. Gregory expressed that half-empty bitcoin blocks tell a cautionary tale, warning that focusing solely on bitcoin as a store of value could jeopardize its future. He emphasized the importance of using bitcoin for real commerce, stating, ""If we don’t get people using bitcoin for real commerce, it’s game over.""",04-03-2025

According to CoinDesk, the payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP is trading near a crucial support zone around $2, a level that could confirm a significant topping pattern and signal a renewed downtrend. This pattern, known as the head-and-shoulders formation, consists of three peaks, with the middle peak being the highest. The neckline, a horizontal line drawn from the base of these peaks, marks the key demand zone for XRP. Since January, the $1.90-$2 range has served as this demand zone for XRP. A price movement below this range would trigger a breakdown of the head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating a shift from a bullish to a bearish trend. Veteran analyst and trader Peter Brandt suggests that a potential breakdown could see XRP's price nearly halve to $1.07. Chart analysts use the measure move method to identify targets, which involves calculating the distance from the top of the head to the neckline and subtracting that distance from the breakdown point, in this case, $2. On the upside, XRP bulls need to overcome the $3 level, which represents the lower high created in early March. This level is crucial for any potential bullish momentum.

According to Cointelegraph, a key communication tool for Bitcoin developers faced a temporary suspension on April 2, when Google Groups banned the Bitcoin Development Mailing List for spam-related issues. This disruption lasted several hours, affecting the ability of Bitcoin core developers and researchers to discuss potential protocol changes. Google cited the presence of spam, malware, or other malicious content as the reason for the ban.

According to PANews, JPMorgan's Chief Economist Michael Feroli has issued a report highlighting the potential economic impact of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Feroli notes that while the tariffs could generate substantial revenue, they may lead to increased prices, affecting consumer purchasing power. He stated that the newly announced tariffs could raise nearly $400 billion in revenue, approximately 1.3% of GDP. The measures are expected to increase personal consumption expenditure prices by 1-1.5% this year, with inflation effects anticipated by mid-year. The resulting hit to purchasing power could lead to negative growth in real disposable personal income from the second to third quarter, potentially causing a contraction in real consumer spending during these periods. This impact alone could pose a risk of recession for the economy. Additionally, JPMorgan analysts estimate that over one-third of emerging market companies may be significantly affected once U.S. trade tariffs take effect.

Binance,"EY Enhances Nightfall Blockchain with Zero-Knowledge Rollup Design
According to Cointelegraph, the Big Four accounting firm formerly known as Ernst & Young has transitioned its enterprise-focused layer 2 blockchain, Nightfall, to a zero-knowledge rollup design. This change is aimed at providing near-instant transaction finality on the Ethereum network. EY announced on April 2 that the new source code, ""Nightfall_4,"" simplifies the network's architecture, making it more accessible to users compared to its previous optimistic rollup-based version. The shift away from optimistic rollups eliminates the need for users to challenge potentially incorrect transactions on Ethereum and endure the challenging period, thereby accelerating transaction finality. Zero-knowledge rollups ensure that a transaction becomes final as soon as it is added into a Nightfall block, according to EY. Paul Brody, EY's global blockchain leader, stated, ""This update to version four represents a major update to Nightfall, providing the same privacy and scaling that version three enabled, but now with near-instant finality and a simplified architecture."" This marks the fourth major update to Nightfall since its launch in 2019, aimed at enabling EY's business partners to transfer tokens privately using Ethereum's security while being more cost-effective than the base network. Nightfall employs technology that binds a verified identity to a public key through digital signatures to mitigate counterparty risk. Nightfall also collaborates with EY's other primary blockchain solution, OpsChain, to offer a supply chain tracking platform for financial, logistics, and manufacturing businesses. While Nightfall's code is open source on GitHub, it remains a permissioned blockchain for EY's customer base. Competitors to EY's Nightfall include IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, and the Consensus-built Quorum. This development underscores EY's commitment to advancing blockchain technology for enterprise applications, enhancing privacy, scalability, and transaction efficiency on the Ethereum network.",04-02-2025

Binance,"West Virginia's Bitcoin Reserve Bill Aims to Enhance State Sovereignty
According to Cointelegraph, West Virginia's proposed Bitcoin strategic reserve bill seeks to bolster state sovereignty and provide freedom from a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC). State Senator Chris Rose, the bill's sponsor, emphasized the importance of decentralized currency and the public's desire for financial independence from federal control. The bill, introduced in February, proposes allowing the state treasury to invest up to 10% of public funds in precious metals, stablecoins, or digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $750 million over the past year, with Bitcoin currently being the sole qualifying asset. Senator Rose explained that the market cap requirement was designed to ensure the state's exposure to cryptocurrency while avoiding investments in volatile assets like memecoins. He believes adopting Bitcoin at the state level would enhance state sovereignty and align with the interests of individuals who already invest in Bitcoin privately. The proposed 10% allocation of state funds is intended to introduce Bitcoin to the state in a manner that minimizes fear among those unfamiliar with digital assets, providing a balanced exposure. Despite the potential benefits, the bill faces challenges due to skepticism among lawmakers and financial experts regarding Bitcoin's volatility and price fluctuations. Concerns about financial instability make Bitcoin a contentious choice for state investments. While similar Bitcoin strategic reserve bills have emerged in various state legislatures across the United States, many have struggled to pass or have been modified significantly, even in conservative states. Currently, 47 such bills have been introduced in 26 states, with notable progress in Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas. Senator Rose clarified that the funds allocated to precious metals, stablecoins, or Bitcoin would be sourced from the state's pensions fund and severance tax fund, allowing divestment from existing ETF funds. This approach aims to keep the investments separate from the petty cash fund used for daily state expenses, focusing instead on longer-term assets. West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey, who envisions a future state economy driven by crypto and technology, is not expected to oppose the bill, nor is the state treasurer, who was consulted prior to its introduction.",04-02-2025

Binance,"DTCC Launches Blockchain Platform for Tokenized Collateral Management
According to CoinDesk, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), recognized as the world's largest securities settlement system, is advancing its involvement in the cryptocurrency sector by unveiling a blockchain-based platform designed for tokenized collateral management. Collateral plays a crucial role in risk management within financial markets, providing stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often encounter inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and delayed settlements. DTCC's newly introduced platform aims to tackle these issues by tokenizing collateral using blockchain technology, facilitating real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts. This innovation operates within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which is built on LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain. Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, emphasized the significance of collateral mobility as a pivotal application for institutional blockchain use. He noted that smart contracts enable comprehensive collateral operations, allowing complex trade execution across markets in real-time, even under volatile conditions. Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets, highlighted the platform's uniqueness, describing it as more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than previous digital collateral initiatives. The move comes as the tokenization of traditional financial instruments, including bonds, funds, and other investments, emerges as a prominent use case for blockchain technology. Major financial entities such as BlackRock, CME Group, and Fidelity are exploring the advantages of operational efficiencies, faster settlements, and enhanced transparency compared to conventional financial systems. DTCC plans to demonstrate the platform’s capabilities at ""The Great Collateral Experiment"" event on April 23, where industry participants will test the mobilization of tokenized assets across markets. The company also intends to collaborate with regulators and industry leaders to establish global standards for tokenized collateral, aiming to further integrate blockchain technology into the financial sector.",04-02-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin Investment Timing: Insights from Bitwise's Matt Hougan
According to Cointelegraph, Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise, has provided a detailed analysis on the current investment landscape for Bitcoin (BTC). Hougan argues that, from a risk-adjusted perspective, there has never been a more favorable time to invest in Bitcoin. He highlights the transformation of Bitcoin from its early days, which were fraught with technology risks, regulatory threats, trading inefficiencies, and reputational concerns. Today, these risks have significantly diminished, paving the way for Bitcoin's integration into the global financial ecosystem. Hougan points to several key developments that have contributed to Bitcoin's growing stability and acceptance. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, the adoption by major institutional investors, and even the strategic reserve of Bitcoin by the U.S. government have all played a role in solidifying its position. He notes that Bitcoin currently represents only 10% of gold's market value, suggesting that it has substantial room for growth. Hougan believes that matching gold's market value is merely a milestone in Bitcoin's long-term journey, implying a potential tenfold increase from its current valuation. Furthermore, Hougan discusses Bitcoin's long-term price potential and the anticipated acceleration of institutional adoption. He emphasizes the structural long-term demand that is poised to enter the market, which is set against a backdrop of severely limited new supply. This dynamic, according to Hougan, could drive Bitcoin to unprecedented heights.

Binance,"Cryptocurrency Holders Face Increased IRS Scrutiny in 2025
According to CoinDesk, cryptocurrency holders are experiencing heightened scrutiny from the IRS in 2025, with audits on the rise. The evolving tax regulations mean that even minor oversights can lead to significant penalties or costly audits. As the IRS intensifies its focus on cryptocurrency transactions, investors must be vigilant in their reporting practices to avoid potential pitfalls. One common mistake is neglecting wallet-based accounting. The IRS now requires detailed reporting of each wallet's transactions and balances, eliminating the practice of consolidating all trades on a single spreadsheet. Whether using hot wallets, cold wallets, or a combination, each wallet's records must be individually tracked. Tools such as CoinTracking, CoinLedger, or TaxBit can assist in syncing real-time data from various exchanges, ensuring compliance and preventing surprises during IRS audits. Another frequent error involves misreporting staking rewards. These rewards are considered taxable income as soon as they are received, regardless of whether they have been sold for fiat currency. Many investors mistakenly believe they only need to report staking income upon sale, but the IRS requires reporting at the time of receipt. For example, earning 2 ETH worth $3,000 in staking rewards constitutes taxable income when received. Failing to accurately report these amounts can attract unwanted attention from regulators closely monitoring crypto activities. Additionally, overlooking IRS letters and Form 1099-DA can lead to complications. Notices such as Notice 6371, Notice 6374, and CP2000 may be issued if discrepancies are found in tax filings. In 2025, crypto exchanges will also issue Form 1099-DA, detailing crypto income, trades, and rewards. Any inconsistency between this form and reported information is a clear red flag. It is crucial to review these documents for accuracy and address any errors promptly to prevent escalation. Failing to report all transactions is another pitfall. The IRS and its partners possess advanced blockchain analysis tools capable of tracking activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and privacy coins. Every transaction, including trades, airdrops, forks, and rewards, must be included in tax filings. Unreported transactions linked to wallet addresses can lead to significant issues. Lastly, the 2025 tax year offers an opportunity to adjust the crypto cost basis under new guidelines. Investors can reallocate unused cost basis across wallets or exchange accounts, provided they document the method before their first 2025 trade and adhere to specific record-keeping requirements. This can reduce capital gains tax liability. However, excessive deductions, such as inflating business expenses or hobby-related costs, can trigger audits if deemed unrealistic. The IRS scrutinizes deductions that do not align with typical income levels, so maintaining reasonable claims and thorough supporting records is essential. To remain audit-ready, cryptocurrency investors should utilize reliable crypto tax software, meticulously review their returns, maintain comprehensive records, and be transparent about any past errors. A proactive approach ensures preparedness for IRS inquiries and allows investors to focus on their crypto investments.",04-02-2025

According to ShibDaily, governments are increasingly focusing on managing seized cryptocurrency assets, with Russia and the United States taking significant steps in this area. Russia is preparing to convert confiscated Bitcoin into state revenue, following a high-profile criminal case involving Marat Tambiev, a former investigator convicted of accepting bribes from hackers. Dmitry Aristov, head of Russia's Federal Bailiff Service, described Bitcoin as a ""problematic asset"" due to the challenges in liquidating it. He noted that the service is collaborating with relevant authorities to develop a methodology for handling such financial instruments. The Bitcoin in question, valued at over 1 billion rubles, was ordered by the court to be handed over to the state, although a clear process for its sale is still lacking. Aristov highlighted the need for new legislation to regulate cryptocurrency circulation in Russia. Additionally, a bill aimed at legally recognizing crypto as property to simplify seizures has reportedly been submitted to the Russian government. These developments in Moscow highlight the practical difficulties governments face in managing forfeited digital assets and the evolving legal status of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, the United States government is conducting a comprehensive audit of its federally held Bitcoin, expected to conclude this Saturday. This marks the first full accounting of Bitcoin holdings across various agencies, following directives related to establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Unlike Russia's immediate liquidation plans, the U.S. reserve is intended as a long-term holding, not for active selling. The U.S. government's Bitcoin holdings are substantial, estimated at around 198,000 BTC, worth approximately $16 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence. Although the government has previously sold some seized crypto, it retains a significant amount acquired through forfeitures over the years. The audit results could provide market insights, as suggested by David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc., who noted that the findings might clarify recent price movements.

As markets remain volatile amid U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy announcements, analysts at K33 Research say that focus could soon shift back to a major bullish narrative — the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan.On April 2, Vetle Lunde, Research Director at K33, and David Zimmerman, Senior Analyst, said in a market note that ongoing tariff headlines have overshadowed progress on the Bitcoin Reserve initiative, but this narrative is likely to regain center stage once the geopolitical noise settles.U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Strategy: Report Due April 5The executive order signed by Trump on March 6 mandates the creation of a ""U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" using approximately 200,000 BTC (worth $17 billion at current prices) seized via civil or criminal forfeiture, with funds allocated to reimburse victims of financial crimes.By regulation, federal agencies are required to submit a legal authority report by April 5, detailing whether and how these digital assets can be moved into a federally managed strategic reserve.The executive order also tasks Treasury Secretary Scott Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Rutnik with crafting a budget-neutral strategy to acquire and manage the Bitcoin holdings — meaning no direct taxpayer funding will be used.Key Timeline AheadApril 5: First formal report due on federal authority to hold and manage seized digital assets.May 5 (approx.): Deadline for Besent's legal and investment framework report outlining the acquisition strategy.Mid-to-late May: A crypto summit may be convened to discuss the role of Bitcoin in the U.S. economy, potentially serving as a catalyst for renewed bullish sentiment.Market Implications""Once tariff-driven macro volatility subsides, we expect attention to swing back toward the U.S. Bitcoin Reserve narrative, which could rekindle investor enthusiasm,"" Lunde and Zimmerman noted.Analysts say the legal confirmation of BTC holdings by a nation-state, particularly the United States, would mark a historic milestone for Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a reserve asset, fueling speculation and potentially driving prices higher.",04-02-2025

Fluid ranked second on Ethereum with $9 billion, contributing to Ethereum’s dominance despite the broader market correction.Ether (ETH) Underperforms Solana (SOL) Despite Ecosystem StrengthDespite reclaiming DEX leadership, Ethereum’s native token ETH fell 18% in March, closing at $1,822, compared to Solana’s 15.8% decline. Analysts attribute ETH's underperformance to:Inflationary tokenomics: Concerns over Ethereum's issuance model persist.Layer 2 competition: Increased adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism may be diverting activity and value away from the mainnet.Market OutlookThe broader crypto market capitalization dropped 4.2% in March to $2.63 trillion, following a 20% decline in February. Contributing factors include macroeconomic uncertainty and disappointment over the U.S. strategic reserve’s inactivity in BTC purchases, which pressured Bitcoin below $80,000, according to CoinDesk.",04-02-2025
Binance,"Bitcoin New: Bitcoin May Have Found a Bottom After 30% Drop From All-Time High, History Suggests
Bitcoin (BTC) may have finally bottomed out after a steep 30% correction from its all-time high of $109,000, with technical indicators and historical patterns hinting at a potential bullish turnaround.BTC Forms Higher Lows After $76K BottomAfter plunging to a low of just over $76,000 on March 10, BTC has since charted a series of higher lows — around $78,000 on Feb. 28 and $81,000 on March 31 — forming what analysts describe as a triangular bottom pattern. This structure signals seller exhaustion and increasing buying pressure, a common feature of past reversal zones.Historical Parallels Suggest Upside PotentialBTC’s recent price action mirrors patterns seen after two major macro events:January 2024 – U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Launch: BTC saw a 20% correction, hitting a low below $40,000 on Jan. 23, with higher lows before and after that date.August 2024 – Yen Carry Trade Unwind: BTC bottomed at $49,000 on Aug. 5, with higher lows observed in early July and again in early September.In both cases, these patterns preceded renewed upside momentum, leading some traders to believe that a similar breakout could be in play now.Expert Insights: Bullish Structure EmergingOmkar Godbole, Managing Editor at CoinDesk Markets, highlighted the shift from lower lows to higher lows in the current market, noting it aligns with historical bottoming signals.“The latest pattern resembles the structures seen during past corrections, signaling that sellers are losing strength and a bullish momentum shift may be underway,” Godbole said.Caution: Trump’s Tariff Plans Could Disrupt the TrendDespite the encouraging technical setup, macro uncertainty remains a major risk. Investors are closely watching U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, set for April 2, which could impact market sentiment across both equities and crypto.Key Levels to Watch:Support: $76,000 (March 10 low)Resistance: $85,000–$89,000 rangeBreakout Target (if pattern holds): Potential retest of $100,000+Bottom Line:While no bottom is confirmed until key resistances are broken, Bitcoin’s recent higher lows suggest the worst of the correction may be over. If historical cycles repeat, BTC could be primed for a renewed uptrend—barring any macroeconomic shocks that could derail investor confidence.Traders should keep an eye on volatility leading into April as markets digest potential tariff announcements and broader risk sentiment, according to CoinDesk.",04-02-2025

Binance,"Global Markets Face Pressure Amid U.S. Tariff Measures
According to BlockBeats, U.S. President Donald Trump is set to announce a series of tariff measures in the Rose Garden, which is expected to exert pressure on risk assets in the short term. As the situation stabilizes, there may be instances of 'non-U.S. exceptionalism,' where global stock indices could continue to rise, potentially reaching new highs despite the U.S. being marginalized due to policy choices. The market anticipates that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates 2.5 times in 2025. The Fed faces challenges with weak consumer confidence and soft data, indicating a potential slowdown in U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter. Inflation pressures from tariffs may begin to intensify from April 2, creating a classic stagflation environment where the Fed might lean towards raising rates rather than cutting them. Currently, the Fed appears to be adopting a wait-and-see approach. In the cryptocurrency sector, market sentiment remains subdued. Bitcoin continues to fluctuate without a clear direction, while Ethereum holds at the $1,800 support level. Overall, the crypto market shows signs of weakness, with many cryptocurrencies down 90% year-to-date, and some experiencing declines of over 30% in the past week. Without significant changes in the macroeconomic environment or strong catalysts, a substantial market reversal is not anticipated. Although light positions might support minor gains, any pursuit of upward trends is unlikely until the macro environment improves.",04-02-2025
Binance,"Amber Group's Nasdaq Listing Signals Growth for Crypto Companies
According to CoinDesk, Amber Group's recent listing on Nasdaq marks a significant milestone for the crypto industry, potentially paving the way for more companies to follow suit. Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, highlighted that this move could attract institutional investors who previously lacked a structured entry into the crypto market. Pantera Capital, an early investor in Amber Group, sees this as an opportunity to bring fresh capital into the market, which analysts have noted is currently lacking. Veradittakit mentioned that several U.S. companies are considering public listings, with ten companies in Pantera's portfolio contemplating this move. This includes crypto custody firms, stablecoin issuers, and developer platforms. Notably, Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange. Veradittakit emphasized that clearer and more supportive U.S. regulations are providing essential ""tailwinds"" for crypto IPOs, enabling international companies like Amber to explore public listings in the country. Amber Group's listing demonstrates that the crypto market is not a zero-sum game between Asia and the U.S. but rather a bridge connecting U.S. liquidity with Asian innovation and expertise. Wayne Huo, CEO of Amber Group, stressed that the financial market is large enough to accommodate cooperation between regions. He noted that technological breakthroughs occur most rapidly when the East and West collaborate. Amber plans to leverage the capital and visibility from its listing to support international expansion and the development of institutional crypto financial services.

Binance,"Financial Markets Brace for Impact as U.S. Tariff Announcement Looms
According to CoinDesk, Wednesday could be a significant day for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, as U.S. President Donald Trump is anticipated to announce extensive reciprocal tariffs aimed at addressing what he perceives as unfair trading practices by the United States' partners. This announcement is expected to have wide-ranging implications, potentially affecting various sectors, including the cryptocurrency market. In the lead-up to this announcement, there are indications of a downtrend exhaustion in the ether (ETH) market. Historically, ETH has lagged behind Bitcoin during the two-year cryptocurrency bull run. However, if the forthcoming tariffs are less severe than anticipated, ETH might take the lead. Recently, ether prices fell alongside bitcoin, but sellers were unable to push prices below the 16-month low of $1,755 reached on March 11. This inability to breach the low is seen as a sign of seller fatigue or downtrend exhaustion. Since then, ether prices have rebounded to $1,880, hinting at a potential double bottom formation with resistance at $2,104. A breakthrough at this level could confirm a bullish breakout, paving the way for a rise to $2,400, identified as the next resistance level using the measured move method. Additionally, a bullish divergence has been observed. While prices revisited the March 11 low last week, the histogram, which measures the spread between the price and its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), did not follow suit and instead formed a higher low. This divergence suggests that although prices declined, the momentum behind the downward movement weakened. Furthermore, the three-line break chart, which had been in a prolonged downtrend, has now flipped bullish, indicating a significant shift in market sentiment. This is evidenced by the appearance of a green bar on the daily time frame, signaling a potential reversal in price momentum. The previous bullish signal from early March was short-lived and turned out to be a bear trap. However, the latest bullish flip appears more reliable as it is supported by signs of downtrend exhaustion on candlestick charts. Despite these positive indicators, macroeconomic factors, such as the anticipated tariffs, could significantly impact market dynamics. Broad-based risk aversion triggered by the tariff announcement could negate all the bullish signals currently observed, potentially leading to further losses in ether. As the market awaits President Trump's announcement, investors remain cautious, aware of the potential for significant market shifts.",04-02-2025

Binance,"XRP Poised for Breakout Amid Bullish Technical Indicators
According to CoinDesk, XRP, the digital token associated with Ripple Labs, is exhibiting signs of a potential breakout as its price chart forms a symmetrical triangle pattern, accompanied by other bullish technical indicators. The token has been consolidating within this pattern, characterized by two converging trend lines that suggest a buildup of momentum. Technical analysis from a well-followed X user indicates that a breakout from this formation could propel XRP toward a short-term target of $6. The symmetrical triangle has been developing over recent weeks, with XRP’s price action tightening as it nears the apex of the triangle. This setup, commonly observed in cryptocurrency markets, often precedes a sharp move, either upward or downward, depending on the direction of the breakout. Fibonacci retracement analysis further supports this outlook, identifying $2.04 as a key support level and $2.2 as a critical resistance. A break above $2.2 could confirm the bullish trend, potentially driving XRP toward the $5 to $8 range in the mid-term. The Elliott Wave framework, which forecasts price movements in five distinct waves based on repeating price patterns, reflects growing optimism in the market. The five-wave pattern indicates increasing investor confidence, while the three-wave correction suggests profit-taking or pessimism. These waves are driven by collective investor psychology and can occur across different timeframes, offering a way to map market behavior. A bullish technical outlook coincides with growing optimism in the crypto market, partly fueled by regulatory developments.

Binance,"Bitcoin's Post-Election Surge Raises Questions About Cycle Peak
According to PANews, investors are closely monitoring Bitcoin's potential rise following the U.S. presidential election. In November 2024, Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high set in March 2024, marking its first true price discovery phase since breaking the $20,000 mark in December 2020. Historically, such transitions have occurred during acceleration phases characterized by high volatility and profitability. The key question now is whether Bitcoin has reached the peak of this cycle or if there is room for further growth. In November 2024, Bitcoin surged 56%, entering a price discovery period reminiscent of past acceleration phases. Historically, Bitcoin first broke $30 in 2013, soaring to a high of $229 before cooling down. Similarly, in 2017, it surpassed $1,100, entering a price discovery phase and rising to nearly $3,000 before stabilizing. These historical breakthroughs highlight the volatility and profit patterns typical of acceleration phases. Each surge was followed by a period of consolidation, which eventually led to a second upward movement. Although the current cycle's trajectory is not fully developed, these historical similarities suggest a potential for similar upward trends. Bitcoin's weekly volatility has rapidly increased, indicating that the recent consolidation phase may be ending. This behavior aligns with observations from previous acceleration phases, where annual volatility rose consistently. From July 15, 2024, to March 6, 2025, annual volatility increased from 45% to 51%. Bitcoin's volatility historically tends to favor upward movements. Monthly returns, compared to the S&P 500, show higher levels in both directions, with more frequent and larger upward movements. Despite this, pullbacks are inevitable during acceleration phases, posing challenges for investors. However, recent pullbacks have been relatively average compared to previous cycles, suggesting that Bitcoin's volatility may decrease as it matures. While the future remains uncertain, historical experience indicates an increased likelihood of explosive peaks as acceleration phases extend. As of March 3, Bitcoin has been in the latest acceleration phase for 232 days, nearing the peak and sudden reversal seen in previous phases. The acceleration phases in 2010-11, 2013, and 2017 peaked on the 244th, 261st, and 280th days, respectively, indicating a slight extension in each cycle. This does not necessarily mean the current phase will end within this specific timeframe. However, history suggests Bitcoin's acceleration phase may conclude with a dramatic surge, followed by a rapid loss of momentum and reversal. A key indicator to watch during acceleration phases is the number of days Bitcoin reaches all-time highs within a 60-day period. In previous phases, Bitcoin typically experienced two significant surges, the first occurring after the election. If a new all-time high is imminent, its starting price will be close to $110,000. It is noteworthy that the second surge failed only once, in November 2021. As the current cycle continues to be monitored, it is important to observe whether Bitcoin follows its historical pattern or begins to show signs of divergence.",04-02-2025

Binance,"UK Trade Associations Urge Strategic Focus on Crypto and Blockchain
According to Cointelegraph, several British trade associations have called on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to appoint a special envoy dedicated to cryptocurrency and develop a comprehensive action plan for digital assets and blockchain technology. In a letter dated March 31, a coalition of six UK digital economy trade bodies appealed to Varun Chandra, Starmer’s special adviser on business and investment, for a more strategic approach to foster investment, growth, and job creation within the crypto industry. The coalition, comprising the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, Global Digital Finance, The Payments Association, Digital Currencies Governance Group, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and techUK, highlighted the United States' policy shift under U.S. President Donald Trump, who appointed a crypto czar. They emphasized that Britain's commitment to an economic trade deal focused on technological cooperation with the US offers a significant opportunity to emulate the United States' ambition in leading blockchain, digital assets, and other emerging financial technologies. The trade bodies recommended that the UK appoint a blockchain special envoy to coordinate policy, encourage innovation, and enhance the country's competitive position in global markets. Additionally, they urged the development of a government action plan for crypto and blockchain technology, including a concierge service to attract high-potential firms. The coalition also suggested that the government recognize and utilize the synergies between blockchain, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence technologies, particularly in potential applications for government services. Another proposal was to establish a high-level industry-government-regulator engagement forum to facilitate informed decision-making and cross-sector collaboration. The UK crypto and tech associations are lobbying the government for a policy shift, arguing that crypto and blockchain technology could significantly boost the UK economy by 57 billion British pounds ($73.6 billion) over the next decade. They also projected that the sector could increase global gross domestic product by 1.39 trillion pounds ($1.8 trillion) by 2030. Tom Griffiths, co-founder and managing partner of crypto compliance advisory firm BitCompli, responded to the letter on LinkedIn, stating that the Financial Conduct Authority possesses considerable talent and foresight but warned that the UK is losing ground to jurisdictions like Dubai, Singapore, and other EU countries.

Binance,"North Korean Tech Workers Expand Operations to European Blockchain Firms Amid U.S. Crackdown
According to Cointelegraph, North Korean tech workers are broadening their infiltration efforts into blockchain firms outside the United States due to increased scrutiny from U.S. authorities. These workers have reportedly penetrated UK crypto projects, as revealed by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) adviser Jamie Collier in a report dated April 2. While the United States remains a primary target, heightened awareness and challenges related to right-to-work verification have compelled North Korean IT workers to seek employment with non-U.S. companies. Collier noted that in response to the increased awareness of the threat within the United States, North Korean operatives have established a global network of fraudulent personas to enhance their operational flexibility. The discovery of facilitators in the UK suggests the rapid development of a global infrastructure and support network that enables their continued operations. These workers are infiltrating projects that range from traditional web development to advanced blockchain applications, including those involving Solana and Anchor smart contract development. The GTIG has identified North Korean workers involved in projects building blockchain job marketplaces and artificial intelligence web applications leveraging blockchain technologies. These individuals pose as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate companies and generate revenue for the regime, placing organizations that hire Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) IT workers at risk of espionage, data theft, and disruption. Collier also highlighted a notable focus on Europe, with North Korean workers using multiple personas across the continent. Some workers have used resumes listing degrees from Belgrade University in Serbia and residences in Slovakia. Separate investigations by GTIG found personas seeking employment in Germany and Portugal, login credentials for user accounts on European job websites, instructions for navigating these sites, and a broker specializing in false passports. Since late October, North Korean workers have increased extortion attempts, targeting larger organizations. GTIG speculates that this is due to pressure to maintain revenue streams amid the U.S. crackdown. Recently fired IT workers have threatened to release sensitive data from their former employers or provide it to competitors, including proprietary data and source code for internal projects. In January, the U.S. Justice Department indicted two North Korean nationals for their involvement in a fraudulent IT work scheme affecting at least 64 U.S. companies from April 2018 to August 2024. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control also sanctioned companies accused of being fronts for North Korea, generating revenue through remote IT work schemes.

According to Odaily, Synthetix founder Kain recently highlighted the economic challenges Ethereum's mainnet is facing due to the expansion of Layer 2 (L2) solutions and the introduction of EIP-4844, which reduces data availability costs through Blob technology. Kain noted that the rise of L2 solutions has diverted revenue that traditionally belonged to the mainnet, and future shifts towards alternative data availability solutions like Celestia could further weaken Ethereum's profitability. To address this issue, Kain suggested short-term measures such as official L2 support or rental mechanisms to allow L2 solutions to benefit the mainnet. In the long term, he emphasized the need for new demands, such as the tokenization of real-world assets, to enhance the overall usage of both Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2. Kain stressed that the Ethereum community has a coordination advantage but should decisively abandon unrelated projects and focus resources on breakthroughs at the application layer to tackle competition from L2 and other data availability solutions.",04-02-2025

It serves to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts, ensuring that contract prices remain close to the underlying asset prices. A funding rate of 0.01% is considered the baseline rate.

According to CoinDesk, CoreWeave (CRWV) shares experienced a significant increase of over 38% on their third day of trading following the company's initial public offering (IPO). This surge comes after OpenAI's announcement of a record-breaking $40 billion funding round on Monday, which has positively influenced investor sentiment towards artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. CoreWeave, an AI startup, made its public debut on the Nasdaq exchange last Friday. Initially, the stock fell below its IPO price, closing at $40, and further declined by 10% on Monday, marking its first full trading day. The IPO occurred amidst global market uncertainties, which had dampened investor enthusiasm and risk tolerance. However, the landscape shifted on Tuesday as OpenAI's substantial funding round, valuing the company at $300 billion, reassured investors of the robust demand for AI enterprises despite challenging market conditions.

Binance,"Ethereum's Blob Fees Hit Record Low Amid Scaling Challenges
According to Cointelegraph, the Ethereum network has experienced a significant decline in its primary revenue source from layer-2 (L2) scaling chains, known as ""blob fees."" Data from Etherscan reveals that in the week ending March 30, Ethereum earned only 3.18 Ether (ETH) from blob fees, equivalent to approximately $6,000 as of April 1, 2025. This represents a 73% decrease from the previous week and a staggering 95% drop from the week ending March 16, when blob fee income surpassed 84 ETH. The decline in blob fees follows Ethereum's Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which shifted L2 transaction data to temporary offchain stores called ""blobs."" While this upgrade reduced costs for users, it also significantly decreased Ethereum's overall fee revenue, initially by as much as 95%, according to asset manager VanEck. Matthew Sigel, VanEck's head of digital asset research, noted in a November 2024 post on the X platform that ""ETH Fees Were Weak Due to Lack of Blob Revenues as L2s Have Not Filled Available Capacity."" Since then, the growth in blob fees has been inconsistent, with Ethereum's weekly blob fee income peaking at nearly $1 million in November before sharply declining in recent weeks, as reported by Dune Analytics. The ongoing struggle to generate substantial income from blob fees highlights concerns about Ethereum's scaling model, which heavily relies on L2s for transaction throughput. Arndxt, author of the Threading on the Edge newsletter, emphasized in a March 31 X post that ""Ethereum’s future will revolve around how effectively it serves as a data availability engine for L2s."" Michael Nadeau, founder of The DeFi Report, stated in an X post that L2 transaction volumes would need to increase more than 22,000-fold for blob fees to fully offset Ethereum’s peak transaction fee revenues. Despite these challenges, Ethereum's economic model continues to evolve. The network's upcoming Pectra Upgrade, scheduled for this year, aims to significantly alter how Ethereum allocates blob space. Sassal, founder of The Daily Gwei, expressed optimism in a March 17 X post, stating, ""The plan is simple: scale Ethereum as much as possible to capture as much marketshare as we can - worry about fee revenue later."" As Ethereum navigates these growing pains, the focus remains on enhancing its scalability and data availability to support the expanding L2 ecosystem.",04-01-2025

Binance,"Ethereum Faces Continued Bearish Trend Amid Market Challenges
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has experienced a prolonged bearish trend, marking four consecutive months of decline. In March, ETH saw an 18.47% drop, reminiscent of the bear market conditions of 2022. This consistent downward trajectory has sparked discussions among analysts about whether ETH is nearing a bottom or if further declines are imminent. The Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio has also reached a significant low, hitting a five-year low of 0.021 on March 30. This ratio, which measures ETH's value against Bitcoin (BTC), highlights Ether's underperformance compared to Bitcoin over the past five years. The last time the ETH/BTC ratio was at this level was in May 2020, when ETH was valued between $150 and $300. Additionally, Ethereum's monthly fees have dropped to $22 million in March 2025, the lowest since June 2020, indicating reduced network activity and market interest. These fees reflect the cost of transactions on the network, which decrease when network demand is low. Despite these challenges, some analysts, like VentureFounder, suggest that the ETH/BTC ratio might find a bottom in the coming weeks, potentially between 0.017 and 0.022. This prediction is based on historical patterns and market cycles, drawing parallels to the 2018-2019 period of Federal Reserve tightening and quantitative easing. VentureFounder anticipates a potential recovery following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) actions in May, when the Fed is expected to end quantitative tightening and begin quantitative easing. Historically, Ethereum has shown resilience after consecutive bearish months. Since its inception, ETH has experienced three or more consecutive bearish monthly candles on five occasions, each time resulting in a short-term bottom. Notably, in 2018, after seven consecutive red months, ETH prices surged by 83% following the correction. In 2022, after three bearish months, ETH consolidated for nearly a year, with the bottom occurring in June 2022. Historically, Ethereum has a 75% probability of experiencing a positive month in April, and its past quarterly returns indicate that Q2 typically sees fewer drawdowns compared to other quarters, with average returns as high as 60.59%.

Binance,"Kristin Smith to Lead Solana Policy Institute as President
According to CoinDesk, Kristin Smith, the longstanding chief executive of the Blockchain Association, is set to depart next month to assume the role of president at the newly established Solana Policy Institute. This announcement was made on Tuesday, marking a significant shift in leadership within the crypto policy landscape in Washington. Smith expressed her pride in the accomplishments achieved during her tenure and conveyed optimism about the organization's future prospects. Earlier this week, Miller Whitehouse-Levine, who recently stepped down from the Defi Education Fund, founded the Solana Policy Institute and announced his position as CEO. Although the institute has not yet disclosed its funding sources, its website emphasizes a focus on promoting decentralized networks like Solana as pivotal to the future of the digital economy. Smith's leadership at the Blockchain Association spanned nearly seven years, a period marked by significant developments in the crypto industry. Over the past year, the political environment has become more favorable for the sector, with crypto advocates gaining allies across various levels of the U.S. government, striving for comprehensive regulatory frameworks. The Blockchain Association has played a central role in lobbying efforts for the industry. In light of Smith's departure, the organization has initiated a search for her successor. Whitehouse-Levine, who previously contributed to the policy operations of the Blockchain Association, emphasized the importance of providing innovators with the clarity needed to build a seamless, internet-based global economy. He believes that with appropriate laws, rules, and frameworks, this vision is attainable.

Binance,"MicroStrategy Faces Challenges in Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy
According to CoinDesk, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) aggressive acquisition of bitcoin (BTC) has propelled its shares to increase by over 2,500% in the past five years. However, analyst Gus Gala from Monness Crespi has expressed concerns that this trend may reverse. Gala recently downgraded MicroStrategy's stock to sell, just two weeks after initially rating it as neutral. He cited a growing confidence that the company's convertible issuance strategy might be exhausted. MicroStrategy currently holds 528,185 BTC on its balance sheet and has been consistently purchasing large amounts of bitcoin weekly, primarily funded through common share issuance and sales of its initial preferred series STRK. Gala's price target for MicroStrategy is set at $220, indicating a potential downside of nearly 30% from its current price, which is around $300. Gala highlighted the increasing difficulty MicroStrategy may face in raising funds to purchase bitcoin through share issuance, suggesting a shift towards fixed income vehicles might be necessary. He warned that if fixed income securities do not become a larger part of the company's issuance strategy, its BTC treasury approach could face significant challenges. Gala also pointed out that MicroStrategy has already utilized $18.6 billion of its $21 billion common share at-the-market offering. Additionally, the company raised $711 million last week through STRF, its second series of preferred stock.",04-01-2025
Binance,"Israel Eliminates Remaining U.S. Import Tariffs Amid Trade Negotiations
According to BlockBeats, Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich has signed an order to immediately remove all remaining import tariffs on U.S. goods. This move appears to be aimed at securing a reprieve from reciprocal tariffs expected to be announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday. The directive was coordinated with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Economy Minister Barkat but still requires final approval from the Israeli Parliament's Finance Committee. In a letter dated March 20 to Barkat and Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, Smotrich called for the removal of tariffs on U.S. products, particularly in the agricultural sector. Israel and the United States signed a free trade agreement in 1985, which led to phased tariff reductions, culminating in the near-total elimination of tariffs on manufactured goods by 1995. However, the agreement allows both countries to maintain certain import and tariff restrictions, such as quotas and fees on agricultural products, primarily to protect local production and ensure food security.",04-01-2025

Binance,"Blockchain Industry Faces Rapid Growth Amid Regulatory Changes
According to CoinDesk, the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors are experiencing a rapid acceleration as global regulatory environments align towards a model that allows a broader range of products and services. Companies previously hesitant are now entering the market, while those already involved are strategizing to introduce new offerings. In technology markets, early leaders are often established before mass adoption. As blockchain enters this phase, companies face a choice: act swiftly or risk falling behind for decades. A complacent attitude from leadership could signal a company's surrender in this competitive landscape. For those committed to staying competitive, speed is crucial, but it must be balanced with effective risk management. The mantra of ""move fast and break things"" highlights the importance of managing risks to avoid catastrophic failures. Companies can mitigate these risks by implementing controls and operations that address past industry issues. This approach, while seemingly reactive, is essential to prevent repeating historical mistakes. Basic measures such as external audits, business controls, and best practices are vital. The industry now benefits from a wealth of experienced professionals who can apply lessons learned from past experiences. Strategic risk assessment is another critical component for companies. They must consider various risks, including technology risks associated with smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi), market risks, and counter-party risks. Controlled learning environments can help companies understand these risks without jumping to incorrect conclusions. Often, taking on too many risks simultaneously can obscure the root causes of failures. Furthermore, companies should be strategic about their internal and external operations. In technology firms, there is a tendency to build everything in-house, driven by the satisfaction of creating rather than outsourcing. However, leveraging external expertise, as suggested by the popular notion of consultants being a ""cheat code,"" can reduce risk and complexity. Utilizing the experience of others can be a strategic advantage. Growth inherently involves risk, and this risk escalates with the speed of growth. Therefore, companies aiming for rapid expansion, especially in sectors driven by emerging technologies, must prioritize robust risk management policies. As the industry evolves, maintaining a focus on safety and strategic planning is essential for sustained success.",04-01-2025

According to ShibDaily, the cryptocurrency landscape has evolved significantly since Bitcoin's inception by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Initially perceived as a niche interest for tech enthusiasts and risk-takers, cryptocurrency is now on the brink of mass adoption. This shift is driven by the involvement of major brands, financial institutions, and even governments. The future of cryptocurrency is not solely about technological advancements but also involves navigating the increasing influence of governmental regulations. While some fear that regulation might hinder innovation, others view it as a sign of the industry's maturation. Blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrency, continues to advance, enhancing transaction speed, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. The rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is challenging the traditional banking sector by offering a financial system devoid of intermediaries. The future of cryptocurrency is also intertwined with the metaverse, gaming, and digital ownership, raising questions about the longevity of trends like million-dollar NFT sales and virtual real estate purchases. Privacy remains a significant concern, with privacy-focused coins such as Monero, Zcash, and Dash gaining attention, although governments are wary of fully anonymous transactions. Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the crypto world, but its future dominance is uncertain as the industry expands. The growth of the crypto sector is also creating a burgeoning job market, offering opportunities beyond trading. Environmental concerns have been a point of criticism for cryptocurrency, but emerging solutions aim to make it more sustainable. The future of cryptocurrency is filled with possibilities, whether it becomes a fully integrated part of daily life or remains a niche financial asset.

According to Odaily, veteran strategist and prominent U.S. stock market bull Ed Yardeni has analyzed the increasing likelihood of stagflation due to the cumulative impact of tariffs. These tariffs are expected to be borne by foreign exporters to the U.S., American importers, and consumers, either individually or collectively. The consequence is anticipated to be rising prices and lower corporate profit margins compared to a tariff-free environment. Over the past three years, the U.S. economy has shown resilience in the face of tightening monetary policy. However, consumer confidence in the economy's ability to maintain this resilience under U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies is waning. Recent data indicates that concerns over stagflation are beginning to undermine the strong performance of the U.S. economy, which has not experienced a recession since the pandemic lockdowns began in early 2020. Yardeni suggests that the probability of stagflation has increased to 45%, reflecting the potential for the current stock market correction to develop into a full-blown bear market. In other words, if stagflation occurs, the stock market is expected to enter a bearish phase.",04-01-2025

He notes that Bitcoin is still in the acceleration phase but nearing the cycle's end, having lasted 232 days as of March 3. Historical data shows that the acceleration phases in 2010-2011, 2015, and 2017 peaked on the 244th, 261st, and 280th days, respectively, with each cycle's duration progressively increasing.Historically, acceleration phases typically feature two major upward waves, with the first occurring after the election.

Binance,"APX Lending Secures Exemption for Crypto-Backed Loans in Canada
According to Cointelegraph, APX Lending, a company specializing in crypto-backed loans, has received exemptive relief from the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA). This allows the firm to offer loans backed by cryptocurrencies without the need for traditional dealer registration or prospectus filings. Over the past two years, APX has collaborated with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) to develop a regulatory framework, as no such framework previously existed in Canada. This exemption is specific to APX and does not set a precedent for other companies. APX Lending currently supports Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as collateral for loans in Canadian or US dollars, with terms ranging from three months to five years. The company plans to expand its offerings by including more digital assets and fiat currencies in the future. APX is also looking to extend its services to the United States, with further expansions into Australia and New Zealand contingent on regulatory approval. Andrei Poliakov, the founder and CEO of APX Lending, emphasized the company's commitment to compliance and security in crypto-backed lending, aiming to help both retail and institutional borrowers unlock liquidity while retaining ownership of their digital assets. The loans offered by APX range from 20% to 60% loan-to-value (LTV), with an automated liquidation mechanism that activates at 90% if borrowers do not take corrective action when the LTV reaches the 80% warning level. Borrowers are notified of potential liquidation, allowing them to top up collateral or partially repay the loan. This flexible structure of crypto-backed lending contrasts with the more rigid options available in traditional financial systems. APX Lending is registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), and its main competitors in the local market include Ledn, Nexo, and YouHodler. The political landscape in Canada is shifting, which could impact crypto regulations. The recently elected Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former central banker, has previously criticized Bitcoin for its capped supply, describing it as a 'serious deficiency.' In a 2018 speech, Carney expressed concerns about recreating a virtual global gold standard. His critical stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies may influence future regulatory directions in Canada, creating uncertainty for the country's crypto industry. Despite this, Carney's 2025 platform aims to position Canada as a leader in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and digital industries, amid growing geopolitical competition and trade tensions with the United States.",03-31-2025
Binance,"Concerns Raised Over Elon Musk's Access to SEC Data
According to Cointelegraph, concerns have been raised following reports that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's 'government efficiency' team might gain access to data and systems at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the US House Financial Services Committee, issued a warning on March 31, reiterating her previous concerns expressed in a February letter to acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda. Waters highlighted the potential risks associated with the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessing sensitive SEC information. DOGE, an advisory body to U.S. President Donald Trump, is not an official department established by Congress. Waters warned that granting Musk such access could have severe consequences for U.S. investors and create conflicts of interest. Waters expressed concerns that the SEC could face increased risks of data breaches and market disruptions, potentially leading to significant financial losses for investors, including retirees. She also pointed out that Musk, who has faced multiple SEC enforcement actions for violating securities laws, might exploit his access to confidential business information to benefit his own enterprises and disadvantage competitors. Reports suggest that Musk's DOGE team has contacted the SEC and may soon have access to the commission's systems and data. Since joining the Trump administration as a 'special government employee,' Musk has led efforts to reduce staff at various government agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Many of DOGE's actions have been challenged in federal court, with lawsuits alleging illegal or unconstitutional conduct. The SEC, a major U.S. financial regulator, oversees and regulates many aspects of the cryptocurrency industry, including determining whether certain tokens qualify as securities. Under the leadership of Uyeda and U.S. President Donald Trump, the commission has dropped several lawsuits against crypto firms for alleged securities law violations since January. There is speculation about whether the DOGE team plans to 'purge' the SEC of employees deemed disloyal to the Trump administration, as suggested in some lawsuits related to firings at other government agencies. Cointelegraph reached out to acting chair Uyeda and SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw for comments but did not receive a response before publication. The reported infiltration of the SEC by DOGE coincides with the US Senate Banking Committee's upcoming vote on advancing the nomination of Paul Atkins, President Trump's choice to chair the agency. During his March 27 confirmation hearing, Atkins expressed willingness to collaborate with DOGE if confirmed. Democratic lawmakers at the hearing raised concerns about Atkins' potential conflicts of interest with the cryptocurrency industry.",03-31-2025

This move follows Circle's previous confidential filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024. Circle's journey to go public has faced challenges in the past. In 2021, the company attempted to enter the public market through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger. However, this effort was thwarted by regulatory hurdles from an unyielding SEC and the subsequent cryptocurrency market downturn in 2022. As a result, Circle withdrew from the SPAC deal by the end of 2022. Now, with renewed efforts, Circle is reportedly aiming for a valuation between $4 billion and $5 billion, according to individuals familiar with the situation who spoke with Fortune.

Binance,"Bitcoin News: One in Four S&P 500 Firms Could Hold Bitcoin by 2030, Says Crypto Advisory Executive
A growing number of major U.S. corporations may soon follow the footsteps of Tesla and Strategy (MSTR) by adding Bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets. According to Elliot Chun, partner at tech-focused financial advisory firm Architect Partners, 25% of S&P 500 companies could hold Bitcoin by 2030, driven by both innovation and fear of missing out on potential returns.“I anticipate that by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 will have BTC somewhere on their balance sheets as a long-term asset,” Chun wrote in a blog post published on March 28.Chun believes treasury managers will feel pressured to adopt a Bitcoin strategy, fearing potential job security risks if they fail to explore this growing asset class. “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius. If you tried it and it didn’t work, at least you tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk,” he explained.MSTR Leads the Way, GameStop May Join the ListCurrently, Strategy (MSTR) remains the largest public corporate Bitcoin holder, with over 500,000 BTC on its books. Other notable S&P 500 Bitcoin holders include Tesla and Block, but according to Chun’s forecast, another 123 firms would need to follow suit over the next five years for his prediction to come true.GameStop (GME) recently announced a $1.3 billion convertible note offering, intending to use the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin — potentially making it the next high-profile corporate buyer.Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Hype vs. Long-Term PlayWhile the market has rewarded companies adopting Bitcoin — MSTR's stock has surged over 2,000% since its first BTC purchase in August 2020 — Chun warns against companies expecting to replicate that success.“Companies who are implementing this strategy in hopes of replicating MSTR’s performance are positioning for disappointment,” he said, noting that MSTR’s timing and unique position made it a “one-of-one” case.Bitcoin vs. Gold: The Treasury Asset DebateChun also argued that Bitcoin is more efficient than gold as a treasury asset, calling it a GAAP-recognized tangible asset that is both fungible and liquid — unlike the logistical and storage challenges associated with gold bars.Although the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 expanded access for institutional investors, Chun emphasized that Bitcoin remains an “unproven” treasury strategy, particularly for firms using it solely as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation.Still, optimism is running high among tech leaders. Analysts and executives like Cathie Wood (ARK Invest), Mike Novogratz (Galaxy Digital), Brian Armstrong (Coinbase), and Jack Dorsey (Block) have all forecast Bitcoin prices ranging from $500,000 to $1 million by the end of the decade.As corporate interest rises, Bitwise recently launched the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, tracking companies holding at least 1,000 BTC — further reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin could become a mainstream treasury asset within the next five years, according to Cointelegraph.",03-31-2025

According to CoinShares: Digital asset investment products attracted $226 million in inflows last week, marking nine consecutive trading days of positive sentiment and signaling a cautious recovery among investors. The trend follows a period of record-breaking outflows, with only a slight setback on Friday when $74 million in outflows were recorded, likely triggered by unexpectedly high U.S. core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data that may influence the Fed’s stance on interest rates.Bitcoin Dominates, Short BTC Sees OutflowsBitcoin (BTC) remained the top performer, drawing $195 million in inflows, reinforcing its role as the dominant digital asset for institutional exposure.

According to CoinDesk, CoinShares' Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining (WGMI) exchange-traded fund (ETF) has emerged as the worst-performing ETF of 2025, experiencing a 43% decline year-to-date. This ETF comprises several publicly traded bitcoin miners, with IREN (IREN) being the largest holding at 15%, which has seen a 42% drop. Core Scientific (CORZ) follows closely with a 14% weighting and a 48% decline, while Cipher Mining (CIFR), the third-largest holding at 9.6%, has decreased by 52%. Even NVIDIA (NVDA), the sixth-largest holding at 5%, has not been immune to the downturn, falling over 20% this year. The ETF's investment strategy focuses on companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue or profits from bitcoin mining operations or from providing specialized chips, hardware, software, or other services to companies engaged in bitcoin mining. WGMI consists of 21 holdings and manages $147.2 million in total assets. In stark contrast, metals ETFs have been the top performers of 2025, with several gold mining ETFs ranking in the top five. Notably, the Equity World Basic Materials DAXglobal Gold Miners ETF has risen by 38% year-to-date. Bitcoin miners have encountered significant challenges this year, as the network hash rate, which represents the computational power required to mine bitcoin, continues to climb, nearing all-time highs around 832 EH/s. This has led to a notable divergence between bitcoin’s price and the hash rate. Consequently, mining difficulty has remained close to its peak, making it increasingly difficult for miners to successfully mine new bitcoins. Additionally, transaction fees have remained extremely low, further squeezing miner profitability as rewards from processing transactions remain minimal.",03-31-2025
Binance,"Trump Family Supports New Bitcoin Mining Venture with Hut 8
According to Cointelegraph, several members of U.S. President Donald Trump's family are supporting a new initiative to establish what is intended to become the world's largest Bitcoin mining company. Hut 8, a digital asset mining and infrastructure firm, announced on March 31 that it is acquiring a majority stake in American Bitcoin, previously known as American Data Center. This company was founded by a group of investors, including Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. As part of this acquisition, American Bitcoin will assume ownership of Hut 8's Bitcoin mining hardware. Donald Trump Jr. expressed that the entrepreneurs behind American Data Centers have demonstrated their belief in Bitcoin both personally and through their business endeavors. The new venture aims to become the world's largest and most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while establishing a strong strategic Bitcoin reserve. Although mining operations will continue under Hut 8's compute segment, they will be conducted under the American Bitcoin brand. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot described the launch of American Bitcoin as a significant evolution in the company's strategy. By separating the mining business from other corporate activities, the firm aims to raise its own capital and align each segment of the business with its respective cost of capital. Genoot stated that this move positions Hut 8 towards more predictable, financeable, and lower-cost-of-capital segments, establishing American Bitcoin as a pure-play mining platform designed for exahash growth, Bitcoin production, and operating leverage. This development follows Hut 8's achievement of surpassing $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings after acquiring 990 BTC for $100 million at the end of 2024.

The S&P 500 fell by 1.53%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite decreased by 2.59%. The Magnificent 7 tech index also saw a 2.95% decline. The cryptocurrency market mirrored the stock market's downward trend. Bitcoin surged to nearly $89,000 at the start of the week but fell back following news of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff actions, further impacted by Friday's PCE data. As of the latest report, Bitcoin was priced at $81,884, marking a 4.46% decline over the past seven days. Other major tokens also saw declines, with Ethereum falling below $1,800, approaching new lows. Market sentiment remains subdued, with continued pressure expected until there is clarity on Trump's tariff measures. In the commodities and forex markets, the U.S. dollar index saw a slight weekly decline of 0.05%. Risk aversion suppressed risk assets, while geopolitical tensions supported some market bottoms. Oil prices rose by approximately 2% over the week, and gold continued its four-week rally, reaching a new all-time high with spot gold surpassing $3,100. Weak data from last week has reignited economic concerns, leading to a broad market downturn. With Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" expected to be announced on April 2, market nerves are on edge, and risk aversion is increasing. Additionally, the U.S. March non-farm payroll report is set to be released this Friday evening, followed by a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed held rates steady in March, and the market is eager for Powell's insights on the U.S. economy, inflation, and the impact of Trump's tariff policies to glean new clues about the Fed's monetary policy direction and provide more reliable guidance for April's market trajectory.",03-31-2025

Binance,"Goldman Sachs Raises U.S. Tariff Forecast Amid Trade Tensions
According to PANews, Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its forecast for U.S. tariffs in 2025, warning that escalating trade tensions could severely impact economic growth, inflation, and employment. The investment bank now anticipates the average U.S. tariff rate to rise by 15 percentage points, up from the previous baseline of 10 percentage points. This adjustment is primarily due to expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will announce comprehensive 'reciprocal tariffs' on April 2, imposing an average 15% tariff on all U.S. trade partners, with the actual impact expected to increase by 9 percentage points. Goldman Sachs has also revised its year-end core PCE inflation forecast for 2025, raising it by 0.5 percentage points to 3.5%, citing the impact of rising import costs on inflation. The bank expects GDP growth in the fourth quarter to slow to 1.0%, a 0.5 percentage point decrease from previous estimates, and forecasts the unemployment rate to climb to 4.5% by the end of the year. The probability of a U.S. economic recession within the next 12 months has been increased to 35%, attributed to weakened consumer and business sentiment and indications that policymakers may be more willing to endure short-term economic pain to achieve broader policy objectives. With real income growth already slowing, the economy may be entering a more vulnerable phase, where sentiment and policy risks pose greater challenges than in recent years.

Binance,"Bitcoin's Integration into Corporate Treasuries Expected to Rise by 2030
According to CoinDesk, Bitcoin is transitioning from trading desks to corporate treasuries, with expectations that it will become a standard practice by the end of the decade. Elliot Chun, a partner at Architect Partners, predicts that by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 companies will include Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term asset. This strategy of holding Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset was initially considered unconventional when Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, adopted it in August 2020. The company positioned Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a diversification tool, and a market differentiator. The former CEO, Michael Saylor, publicly embraced Bitcoin, transforming the company into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure. Since then, MicroStrategy's stock has surged over 2,000%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin during the same period, as noted by Chun. Recently, GameStop announced plans to raise $1.3 billion through a convertible note to acquire Bitcoin, following a similar path. Although GameStop's stock initially rose after the announcement, it has since corrected, dropping nearly 15% for the week. Chun suggests that corporate treasurers may soon face career risks not for purchasing Bitcoin, but for ignoring it. He emphasized that ""doing nothing is no longer a defensible strategy."" Data from BitcoinTreasuries indicates that publicly listed companies currently hold 665,618 BTC, representing approximately 3.17% of the total Bitcoin supply. Strategy holds the majority share with 506,137 BTC.

Binance,"XRP's Price Decline Amid Market Sell-Off and Future Prospects
According to Cointelegraph, XRP has experienced a significant decline, dropping nearly 40% to approximately $2.19, following a multi-year high of $3.40 just two months ago. This downturn is part of a broader market sell-off influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, despite positive developments such as the SEC dropping its case against Ripple. Despite this decline, XRP remains up 350% from its November 2024 low of $0.50, indicating a potential consolidation phase after a substantial rally. This sideways movement has sparked debate over whether it marks the end of the bull run or presents a prime buying opportunity. XRP has been trading within a range of $1.77 to $3.21 since January, facing repeated rejections near the upper boundary and diminishing bullish momentum. Analyst CrediBULL Crypto notes that XRP's recent attempt to bounce back stalled below $2.20, suggesting continued bearish control. He anticipates the price may revisit the lower range around $1.77, which could present a potential long entry point. The chart analysis indicates a high-demand zone extending as low as $1.50, where bulls might re-enter the market. CrediBULL suggests that a short-term market-wide bounce, primarily led by Bitcoin, could trigger a temporary recovery. However, he emphasizes that a definitive bullish trend reversal would require a breakout above $3.21. Until such a breakout occurs, XRP is expected to remain in a sideways pattern, with a focus on reactions at the $1.77 support level before committing to a long position. Analyst Stellar Babe highlights the possibility of a bull flag formation within XRP's current range, which could lead to a significant price rally. A bull flag typically forms when the price consolidates within a parallel channel following a strong uptrend, resolving when the price breaks above the upper trendline. If XRP breaks above the $3.21 level, the projected target based on the flagpole's height is around $12, representing a potential 450% increase from current prices. Additionally, a recent analysis by InvestingScoope suggests that XRP is consolidating within a long-term bullish structure, trading inside a five-year ascending channel. This pattern resembles the March 2020 to April 2021 rally, and if it continues, XRP could be poised for its next upward move, potentially reaching $6.50 in the coming months. Despite the recent pullback, the broader bullish cycle remains intact as long as XRP holds above the 50-week moving average.

Binance,"U.S. Recession Concerns Rise Amid Trade War and Economic Uncertainty
According to Cointelegraph, the United States faces a 40% chance of entering a recession in 2025, driven by the potential for an extended trade war and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Market analyst and Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin highlighted these concerns in a recent interview, noting that while a recession is not inevitable, the current economic climate could negatively impact risk-on assets such as cryptocurrencies. Puckrin stated that although U.S. President Donald Trump and his advisors have not ruled out the possibility of a recession, it remains unlikely at present, though the likelihood has increased significantly. Puckrin further explained that President Trump is not deliberately trying to trigger a recession. However, actions taken by his administration, such as reducing federal jobs and cutting spending to balance the budget, could inadvertently lead to economic downturns. The macroeconomic uncertainty has also contributed to a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), as investors seek more stable opportunities in European markets, moving away from the volatility affecting U.S. markets. The trade war initiated by President Trump's tariffs on U.S. trading partners has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency markets, causing a significant drop in altcoin prices and a 24% correction in Bitcoin's value from its January 20 peak of over $109,000. This has shifted market sentiment from the optimism following Trump's re-election to a state of extreme fear. Bitcoin's price has struggled under the weight of these trade war concerns, currently trading below its 200-day exponential moving average. Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, indicated that the pressure on crypto markets due to tariffs is expected to persist until April 2025. He suggested that if countries can negotiate an end to the tariffs or if the Trump administration eases its stance, markets may recover. Additionally, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, noted that Bitcoin may have reached a price bottom in March 2025, as President Trump softened his rhetoric on trade tariffs, hinting at a potential price reversal.",03-30-2025

Binance,"Challenges and Regulatory Hurdles in Decentralized Finance
According to Cointelegraph, Shibtoshi, the founder of the SilentSwap privacy-preserving trading platform, has highlighted several issues that deter institutions from embracing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Key concerns include privacy, the absence of standardized compliance regulations, and legal accountability. Shibtoshi pointed out that the transparency of on-chain transactions poses a challenge for companies needing to protect sensitive information such as trading strategies, payroll details, and business agreements. He stated that while regulatory uncertainty, privacy limitations, and complex user experiences are significant concerns, they are solvable. Innovations in privacy-preserving protocols are making DeFi more compatible with enterprise needs, with platforms like SilentSwap leading the way. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major obstacle for DeFi, exacerbated by a fragmented legal approach across jurisdictions, which hinders institutional adoption. Shibtoshi questioned whether DeFi tokens are considered securities and who holds responsibility if a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) encounters issues. He advocated for sensible regulations that foster innovation while preserving the core benefits of decentralized finance, such as self-custody, speed, and cost-effective transactions. Despite these challenges, the total value locked in the DeFi ecosystem has yet to return to the peak levels seen in 2021 and 2022. In a related development, both chambers of the United States Congress recently voted to overturn a controversial DeFi broker rule that required decentralized finance protocols and platforms to report customer transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The U.S. Senate repealed the IRS broker rule with a 70 to 27 vote on March 4, followed by the U.S. House of Representatives voting to repeal the rule on March 11. Despite this repeal, concerns remain that overregulation could stifle a sector designed to be a decentralized, accessible, and pseudonymous alternative to traditional finance. Crypto entrepreneur and investor Artem Tolkachev expressed that regulatory compliance is undermining decentralization in DeFi, threatening the sector's value proposition. He noted that the focus on compliance measures increases the potential for censorship and shifts control from users to third-party intermediaries and large institutions.",03-29-2025

Binance,"Sonic Labs Shifts Focus to UAE Dirham Stablecoin Amid Criticism
According to Cointelegraph, Sonic Labs has decided to abandon its plans to launch a US dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin instead of developing a stablecoin denominated in the United Arab Emirates dirham. This strategic shift was announced by Sonic Labs co-founder Andre Cronje, who initially revealed the company's intention to create a US dollar-pegged stablecoin with an annual percentage rate (APR) of up to 23% on March 22. However, just a week later, Cronje announced a change in direction, stating in a March 28 post on X that the firm would no longer pursue the USD-based algorithmic stablecoin. Instead, Sonic Labs plans to release a mathematically bound numerical Dirham, which will be settled and denominated in USD, but not classified as a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin.The decision to pivot comes shortly after the United Arab Emirates announced its plans to launch a digital dirham central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the fourth quarter of 2025. Khaled Mohamed Balama, governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, highlighted the potential benefits of the blockchain-based dirham, including enhanced financial stability and improved measures to combat financial crime. The digital currency is expected to be accepted alongside its physical counterpart in all payment channels, as the Khaleej Times reports.Sonic Labs faced significant criticism over its initial stablecoin plans, particularly in light of the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, which raised concerns across the crypto industry regarding algorithmic stablecoins. Cronje himself has previously expressed apprehension about algorithmic stablecoins, citing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from previous cycles. The Terra ecosystem's collapse in May 2022 resulted in the loss of tens of billions of dollars in value, with its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) losing its dollar peg and crashing to a low of around $0.30. The sister token LUNA also saw a dramatic decline, plunging over 98% from its early April 2022 value.The fallout from Terra's collapse has prompted regulatory responses, such as the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill, which aims to prohibit algorithmic stablecoins to prevent similar failures. Meanwhile, stablecoins are increasingly being used for smaller, everyday payments rather than large transfers, according to CoinFund managing partner David Pakman. He noted a significant decrease in the size of each stablecoin transaction, indicating their growing use as a payment method rather than for large transfers.",03-29-2025

CoinFund managing partner David Pakman expressed optimism about the stablecoin adoption upswell during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X on March 27. Pakman highlighted the potential increase from $225 billion to $1 trillion within the calendar year, marking a substantial shift for blockchain-based finance despite its modest scale compared to global financial markets.Pakman further suggested that the rise in capital flowing onchain, coupled with growing interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could bolster decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. He noted that if ETFs are permitted to offer staking rewards or yield to holders, it could unlock significant growth in DeFi activity. This perspective aligns with the current stablecoin supply, which reached an all-time high of over $208 billion across the five largest stablecoins on March 28, according to Glassnode data. Pakman emphasized the importance of this movement, stating it represents a major catalyst for onchain wealth transfer that has been absent for over a decade.The stablecoin market continues to expand, recently surpassing $219 billion, indicating that the market is likely still mid-cycle rather than at the peak of a bull run, as suggested by IntoTheBlock analysts. The adoption of stablecoins for daily payments is increasing, showcasing the effectiveness of blockchain-based transactions. Pakman noted a 22-fold increase in stablecoin volume since 2021, with a significant decrease in the size of each transaction, suggesting their use for payments rather than large transfers.

According to Cointelegraph, the New York State Attorney General (NAYG) has initiated legal proceedings against Galaxy Digital, citing its promotional activities related to the now-defunct cryptocurrency Terra (LUNA). This move has been criticized by SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who described it as an unfair use of the legal system. Scaramucci expressed his concerns in a March 28 post on X, labeling the action as 'LAWFARE' due to the Martin Act, a powerful New York law that he believes is prone to misuse.The Martin Act is recognized as one of the most stringent anti-fraud and securities laws in the United States, granting prosecutors the ability to pursue financial fraud cases without the necessity of proving intent. The NAYG has accused Galaxy Digital of violating this act through its alleged promotion of Terra, leading to a $200 million settlement agreement. Documents filed by the NAYG on March 24 reveal that Galaxy Digital acquired 18.5 million LUNA tokens at a 30% discount in October 2020, subsequently promoting and selling them without adhering to disclosure regulations.Anthony Scaramucci defended Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz, stating that Novogratz was under the impression that his statements about Luna were accurate, as he had been misled by Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon. Meanwhile, Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay, admitted to being unfamiliar with the Martin Act, resorting to AI chatbot ChatGPT for clarification. Grossman described the act as broad and essentially embodying the concept of lawfare, expressing sympathy for Novogratz's predicament.The legal filing alleges that Galaxy Digital played a role in boosting the market price of LUNA from $0.31 in October 2020 to $119.18 in April 2022, profiting significantly in the process. Asset manager and investor Anthony Pompliano, while not well-versed in the lawsuit's specifics, vouched for Novogratz's character, describing him as a 'good man' committed to philanthropy. The collapse of Terra remains one of the most notorious failures in the cryptocurrency sector.

Binance,"Ether Faces Decline Amid Layer-2 Challenges and Token Concerns
According to Cointelegraph, Ether (ETH) is experiencing a decline in its appeal as an investment, attributed to the impact of layer-2 solutions siphoning value from the main Ethereum network and a lack of community resistance to excessive token creation. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, highlighted these issues in a March 28 post, stating that the primary cause is the ""greedy Eth L2s siphoning value from the L1 and the social consensus that excess token creation was A-OK."" Carter's comments were in response to Lekker Capital founder Quinn Thompson, who claimed that Ether is ""completely dead"" as an investment. Thompson pointed out that Ethereum, with a market cap of $225 billion, is witnessing declines in transaction activity, user growth, and fees, making it unattractive as an investment despite its utility as a network. The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether's strength relative to Bitcoin, has reached its lowest level in nearly five years, standing at 0.02260. As of the time of publication, Ether is trading at $1,894, marking a 5.34% decrease over the past week and a 17.94% drop over the past month. Cointelegraph Magazine reported in September 2024 that Ethereum's fee revenue had plummeted by 99% over the previous six months due to ""extractive L2s"" absorbing users, transactions, and fee revenue without contributing to the base layer. Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, suggested that Based Rollups could address the issue by altering incentive structures to benefit Ethereum's monetization. Despite previous optimism about Ether reaching $10,000 in 2025, especially after hitting $4,000 in December when Bitcoin reached $100,000 for the first time, Ether has faced a sharp decline amid a broader crypto market downturn. Standard Chartered contributed to the bearish sentiment with a March 17 client letter, revising their end-of-2025 ETH price estimate from $10,000 to $4,000, a 60% reduction.

Immediate finalization occurs when both ZK and TEE validations are successful; otherwise, a seven-day optimistic challenge period is required. The security committee can urgently upgrade proof logic, subject to a 30-day delay, balancing immediate finalization with attack resistance. Lastly, the roadmap suggests building a unified ZK proof aggregation layer. This involves standardizing a proof aggregation protocol across the ecosystem, allowing multiple applications to share the cost of a single proof, such as 500,000 Gas. This approach significantly reduces ZK verification expenses and promotes the adoption of L2 and privacy protocols. The roadmap's goal is to achieve cross-chain bridging within one hour using a short-term hybrid verification mechanism, while reducing costs. In the long term, the aim is to gradually eliminate reliance on TEE, ultimately establishing an efficient, secure, and trustless L2 ecosystem.",03-29-2025

Binance,"Ethereum Community Faces Internal Pressure Over Layer-2 Networks
According to Cointelegraph, a segment of the Ethereum community is urging the Ethereum Foundation to make decisions that could potentially disrupt the social fabric of the smart contract network by imposing restrictions on Ethereum's layer-2 (L2) networks. This sentiment was expressed by Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal during a March 28 episode of Cointelegraph's Chain Reaction show. Nailwal noted that this type of pressure and anti-L2 rhetoric has emerged during the current market cycle, coinciding with suppressed price action for Ether (ETH). Nailwal emphasized the importance of Ethereum's survival for the viability of layer-2 solutions, stating that undue pressure on developers could lead to decisions that might fracture Ethereum's social fabric. He commended Vitalik Buterin's leadership and his active involvement in the Ethereum Foundation, highlighting Buterin's role as a unifying force within the ecosystem. Nailwal described Buterin as the ""DNA"" of the network, which has attracted numerous talented developers who are building on Ethereum's base layer. Nailwal also addressed the distinction between settlement and execution layers, arguing that the layer-1 versus layer-2 dichotomy is a flawed perspective on blockchain networks. He identified Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only true settlement layers in the crypto space, with other networks serving as execution layers. Nailwal predicted that in the future, most applications will operate on their own blockchains to avoid gas fees, ultimately posting final transactions to one of these settlement layers. This development is expected to enhance Ethereum's base layer by accruing value from these final settlements and fostering long-term ecosystem growth, leading to seamless interoperability. Critics of Ethereum's execution layers argue that these scaling networks are currently undermining the base layer, resulting in a significant drop in Ethereum L1 revenue by September 2024. Nailwal concluded that, given the differences between settlement and execution layers, no other crypto network poses a real threat to Ethereum, except for the Bitcoin network. However, he noted that Bitcoin would only become a competitor if it adopted advanced scripting options to enable reliable smart contract functionality similar to Ethereum.",03-28-2025

Binance,"XRP Faces Potential Decline Amid Bearish Patterns and Economic Pressures
According to Cointelegraph, the XRP market is currently experiencing warning signals as a bearish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart. This development coincides with macroeconomic pressures stemming from anticipated U.S. tariffs set to take effect in April. The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern since its rally in late 2024. This pattern is characterized by a flat support level combined with a downward-sloping resistance line, often seen as a bearish reversal indicator. Typically, this setup resolves when the price breaks below the flat support level, potentially leading to a decline equivalent to the triangle's maximum height. As of March 28, XRP was testing the triangle's support, indicating a possible breakdown move. Should this occur, the price could fall to around $1.32 by April, representing a 40% drop from current levels. This descending triangle target aligns with predictions from veteran trader Peter Brandt, who has warned of a potential decline to as low as $1.07 due to a ""textbook"" head-and-shoulders pattern forming on the daily chart. Conversely, a rebound from the triangle's support level could push the price toward its upper trendline at approximately $2.55. A breakout above this resistance could invalidate the bearish structures, potentially driving the price to the previous high of $3.35. In the broader market context, caution is increasing in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on auto imports, scheduled to be implemented on April 3. These tariffs are expected to lead to higher prices for U.S. manufacturers and consumers. The February 2025 U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report already indicated a 0.2% month-over-month increase. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem has estimated that these tariffs could add approximately 1.2 percentage points to inflation, with 0.5 percentage points from direct effects and 0.7 percentage points from indirect effects. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting rates to a target range of 400–425 basis points in June has decreased to 55.7% as of March 28, down from 67.3% a week earlier and 58.4% just one day ago. A delayed rate cut would likely reduce the flow of capital into speculative markets, potentially stalling momentum for XRP and other digital assets that thrive in a low-rate, risk-on environment.

Binance,"Binance Co-Founder He Yi Releases Insightful “Meme Study Note,” Advocates Long-Termism and Strategic Crypto Investment
Binance Co-Founder He Yi has published a comprehensive “Meme Study Note” exploring the evolution of meme culture, the enduring impact of Dogecoin, and the importance of long-termism in crypto investing. Her thought-provoking essay dives into the dynamics of subcultures, investor psychology, and how meme coins and value-driven projects can coexist in the modern Web3 landscape.1. Subculture and the Power of MemesHe Yi emphasizes that meme culture isn’t just viral content—it’s a grassroots movement deeply rooted in collective identity, emotion, and expression. From early internet communities to blockchain-based meme coins, subcultures have moved from the margins to the center of digital influence.“MEMEs are not created by chasing trends or replying to celebrities on Twitter. They are born from the heart,” She wrote.Referencing niche movements like the Zangai Family and Sanhe Gods, she notes that every generation shapes new cultural symbols. Meme expression, she says, deconstructs authority and redefines mainstream narratives, often becoming financialized through crypto.2. Dogecoin: A Blueprint for Community-Driven SuccessHe Yi reflects on the early days of Dogecoin (DOGE), calling it a defining moment for crypto subculture. What began as a parody of Bitcoin evolved into a symbol of generosity and internet-native community building. She credited early Chinese crypto pioneer “Gann” for helping to distribute DOGE globally, creating a grassroots momentum that still echoes today.She cautioned that true MEMEs don’t come from celebrity tweets or influencer hype, but from organic belief systems that grow into cultural products and even new forms of digital religion.“Great MEMEs don’t worship power—they challenge it. And maybe, one day, something could even surpass Doge.”3. Long-Termism Is Not DeadContrary to popular belief that long-term investing is outdated in fast-moving markets, He Yi strongly advocates for it. She compares value investing to gardening: both require patience, vision, and resilience.She explains that while the crypto market has grown exponentially since 2017 and DeFi summer of 2021, confidence has paradoxically weakened. The rise of inflated valuations and fake data has led to disillusionment, and she urges a return to fundamentals through tools like:Community-driven listing and delisting votesDecentralized token offerings via Web3 walletsLow-threshold, low-market cap launches benefiting real users“It’s not that long-termism is wrong—it’s about whether you chose the right object for your belief.”4. He Yi’s Investment Advice: Focus on Certainty, Not HypeHe Yi also shared her personal investment principles—based entirely in cryptocurrency—and offered advice for retail investors:Follow economic cycles: Buy during bear markets, sell in bull markets.Apply the 80/20 rule: Top-performing assets dominate market returns.Diversify smartly: Allocate at least 20% to strong crypto assets.Limit high-risk bets: Don’t allocate more than 10% to volatile tokens unless you’re using leverage or have high-risk tolerance.Execution matters: Knowing is not enough—consistent action is the hard part.“Most people understand what to do. The challenge is doing it—just like weight loss.”Be the Trend, Don’t Chase ItHe Yi concludes with a message for builders and investors alike: the future belongs to those who create, not those who chase.“Many serious projects give up too early. Don’t just follow trends—become the trend.”",03-28-2025

Binance,"Binance Highlights Growing Threat of InfoStealer Malware
Binance Blog published a new article, addressing concerns about recent reports of Binance user credentials appearing on the dark web. The article clarifies that these incidents are not due to a breach of Binance systems but are instead linked to malware-infected devices. This type of malware, known as InfoStealer, is increasingly targeting browser-stored credentials across various industries, including cryptocurrency. Binance emphasizes the importance of user vigilance, as the company actively monitors such incidents, notifies affected users, and assists them in securing their accounts. In recent days, claims have emerged suggesting a potential data breach at Binance, based on the appearance of user credentials on dark web forums. However, Binance's internal investigations have found no evidence of any compromise within its systems. The credentials in question appear to have been harvested from malware infections on individual user devices. These infections are carried out by actors operating in dark web markets, using InfoStealers to extract data from compromised browsers. Binance's security team continuously monitors dark web sources and malware campaigns to identify potential threats. When credentials linked to Binance accounts are detected, the company takes immediate action, including initiating password resets, revoking active sessions, and guiding affected users through account recovery. The threat of InfoStealer malware extends beyond crypto platforms, posing a broader cybersecurity challenge. According to Kaspersky, over 2 million bank card details were leaked last year due to these malware campaigns, and the number continues to grow. Binance's internal data reflects this trend, showing a significant increase in the number of users whose credentials or session data have been compromised by InfoStealer infections. These infections typically affect personal devices where credentials are saved in browsers or auto-filled into websites, rather than originating from Binance itself. InfoStealers are a category of malware designed to extract sensitive data from infected devices without the victim's knowledge. This includes passwords, session cookies, crypto wallet details, and other valuable personal information. These tools are widely available through the malware-as-a-service model, allowing cybercriminals to access advanced malware platforms for a subscription fee. Once stolen, data is sold on dark web forums, Telegram channels, or private marketplaces. The damage from an InfoStealer infection can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and unauthorized access to other services, especially when credentials are reused across platforms. To protect against InfoStealer malware, Binance advises users to employ antivirus and anti-malware tools, enable two-factor authentication, avoid saving passwords in browsers, and download software only from official sources. Keeping operating systems, browsers, and applications up to date is crucial, as is periodically reviewing authorized devices in Binance accounts. Users should also use unique credentials for each account and update them regularly. If malware infection is suspected, immediate action should be taken to change passwords, lock accounts, and report through official Binance support channels. Staying informed and adopting strong security habits are essential in reducing exposure to threats like InfoStealer malware.",03-28-2025

According to Cointelegraph, the non-fungible token (NFT) market witnessed a significant downturn in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plummeting by 63% compared to the same period last year. Total sales from January to March reached $1.5 billion, a stark contrast to the $4.1 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2024, as reported by data aggregator CryptoSlam. March marked the most substantial drop, with sales falling 76% to $373 million from $1.6 billion in the previous year. Despite the overall decline, certain NFT collections managed to defy the trend and post gains. Notable among these were Doodles, Milady Maker, and Pudgy Penguins, which demonstrated resilience amid the market downturn. Pudgy Penguins emerged as the top performer, recording $72 million in sales for Q1 2025, a 13% increase from $63.5 million in Q1 2024. Doodles also showed strength, with sales rising to $32 million from $22.6 million in the previous year, potentially fueled by its growing mainstream presence and a recent collaboration with McDonald's. Milady Maker, an Ethereum-based collection, saw the highest percentage increase among leading collections, with a 58% rise in sales volume. The anime-themed project, endorsed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, has gained traction on social media platforms, partly due to promotion by Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu. In contrast, other major NFT collections experienced significant declines. CryptoPunks recorded $60 million in sales for Q1 2025, a 47% decrease from $114 million in the first quarter of 2024. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) faced an even steeper drop, with sales volume falling 61% to $29.8 million from $78 million in the previous year. While the broader NFT market struggled, NFTs built on Bitcoin saw an increase in average price despite a sharp decline in total sales volume.

Binance,"Iconic Mt. Gox Protest Sign Auctioned Amid Crypto History
According to CoinDesk, the handwritten cardboard sign held by Kolin Burges during his protest outside Mt. Gox's Tokyo office in 2014 is now up for auction. The sign, which became a symbol of one of the first major financial scandals in the cryptocurrency world, is being sold on Scare.City with a reserve price of 4.5 BTC, equivalent to $383,000. The auction begins later this Friday and concludes on April 3. Reflecting on the past, Burges shared his thoughts in an interview in Hong Kong, expressing surprise at the sign's current value. ""At the time, it didn't even cross my mind it could become valuable,"" he said. Burges had traveled from London to Tokyo after Mt. Gox, then the largest bitcoin exchange globally, unexpectedly halted withdrawals. His spontaneous protest quickly captured international media attention, highlighting the growing concerns about the exchange's operations. Burges described his confrontation with Mt. Gox's CEO, Mark Karpeles, as surreal, noting the intense atmosphere as he demanded answers about his missing tokens. As the situation at Mt. Gox deteriorated, the exchange's efforts to manage the public fallout became apparent. Burges recounted how representatives from Mt. Gox attempted to persuade him to cease his protests, warning that continued demonstrations could lead to the exchange's collapse and further losses for bitcoin holders. This interaction, along with a declined Mt. Gox credit card during a meeting, signaled deeper issues within the exchange's financial stability. Mt. Gox eventually filed for bankruptcy in February 2014, shortly after Burges began his protest. In the years following the scandal, Mark Karpeles faced legal challenges, ultimately being found innocent of embezzlement in a Tokyo court but receiving a suspended sentence for data manipulation. In recent developments, Karpeles launched a new crypto exchange, EllipX, and a crypto ratings company, Ungox, in 2022. During an interview at Korea Blockchain Week in August 2024, Karpeles reflected on the Mt. Gox incident, suggesting that modern blockchain analytical tools and third-party custodians could have prevented the crisis. The auction of Burges' sign serves as a reminder of the tumultuous early days of cryptocurrency and the lessons learned from Mt. Gox's downfall.",03-28-2025

According to BlockBeats, a significant TRUMP token holder, identified as EwkH5...rVmjP, has sold off their remaining 590,000 tokens at an average price of $10.62 over the past three hours. This sale, amounting to approximately $6.27 million, resulted in a loss of $1.677 million for the whale. The tokens were originally purchased between February 27 and March 15 at a cost of $13.46 each, leading to a nearly 20% reduction in the whale's position over the past month. The large-scale sell-off has contributed to a further 3% decline in the TRUMP token's price, which is currently valued at $10.46.",03-28-2025

According to BlockBeats, Elon Musk, along with seven members of the DOGE team, made a public appearance in an exclusive interview with Fox News. Musk stated that the reforms initiated by DOGE are transforming the operations of the U.S. government, describing it as the most significant revolution since the American Revolutionary War. He expressed confidence in reducing government spending by $1 trillion by the end of May. This goal suggests that since U.S. President Donald Trump took office on January 20, DOGE aims to achieve this level of cost savings within 130 days. In response to external criticism, Musk defended DOGE's cost-cutting approach as well-considered. He acknowledged the possibility of errors, comparing it to expecting a baseball player to hit the ball every time, which is unrealistic.

Binance,"U.S. Lawmakers Introduce STABLE Act to Regulate Stablecoins
According to ShibDaily, U.S. lawmakers have introduced the STABLE Act, a legislative proposal aimed at enhancing oversight of stablecoins by integrating traditional financial safeguards with digital asset regulations. The bill, presented by Representatives Bryan Steil and French Hill, seeks to improve transparency and accountability as the stablecoin market continues to grow. The STABLE Act, which stands for Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, is currently under review in the Senate after receiving bipartisan support and advancing through the Banking Committee. In addition to the STABLE Act, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee has progressed with the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, marking another legislative effort to regulate stablecoins. While both the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act aim to regulate stablecoins, they differ in their approaches to oversight and issuer requirements. The STABLE Act emphasizes uniform federal regulation, whereas the GENIUS Act allows for a combination of state and federal oversight based on the issuer's size. A notable distinction between the two bills is their treatment of algorithmic stablecoins. The GENIUS Act mandates the U.S. Treasury Department to conduct a comprehensive study on these assets, known as endogenously collateralized stablecoins, to better understand their potential risks. In contrast, the STABLE Act imposes a two-year moratorium on the issuance of algorithmic stablecoins, providing regulators with time to assess their impact and establish necessary safeguards. Another key difference lies in the definition of payment stablecoins. The GENIUS Act updates the definition to exclude stablecoins backed by other digital assets, ensuring that only those supported by tangible, stable reserves qualify. The STABLE Act also refines the definition but adopts a broader approach to integrating stablecoins into financial markets. Both acts represent significant efforts to provide regulatory clarity in the rapidly evolving stablecoin market. As these proposals advance, stakeholders will closely monitor their implications for innovation, financial stability, and consumer protection in the digital asset space.",03-28-2025

Binance,"OTC Weekly Trading Insights (03/27/2025)
Top Interest of the WeekOrca ($ORCA), a leading decentralized exchange on the Solana network, experienced a remarkable 270% surge in its price within just one day. This spike was accompanied by a trading volume that surpassed 180% of its market capitalization, highlighting strong trading interest in the token. Over the last two years, both the trading volume and the total value locked (TVL) in the Orca protocol have consistently grown, attracting the attention of investors.In contrast, Bounce ($AUCTION) has faced notable price volatility in the past two weeks. A whale investor began purchasing $AUCTION when its price was below $20 and later withdrew 2 million AUCTION from the exchange, resulting in a significant reduction in supply. Following this withdrawal, the price of $AUCTION soared to over $60. The whale then returned the asset to the exchange to secure profits. Amid this fluctuating trading landscape, demand for the token through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions has surged.Sui ($SUI), a layer-1 blockchain utilizing the Move smart contract programming language, was one of the top performers in terms of price last year. Recently, $SUI experienced a 10.3% increase in value, driven by news of Canary Capital's application to launch a spot crypto ETF for Sui.Overall MarketSource: TradingViewThe above chart is the BTC price in the daily candle chart at the log scale.Our analysis from the previous week indicated that the price of BTC is likely to keep oscillating between the upper level of 90k and the lower level of 77k. While the overall risk sentiment has improved following the Federal Reserve's scaleback on its quantitative tightening measures, concerns about the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US government persist. As shown in the chart above, BTC is on an upward trajectory within its upward channel. However, our team has noticed some signs of weakness in the bullish momentum. Following an initial surge in price due to the QT scaleback, the market failed to maintain that momentum on Thursday, resulting in a drop from $87k to $83.6k. After a relatively quiet weekend, buyers began to push the price up again on Monday morning in Asia. Unfortunately, significant sell orders were positioned just above the $88,500 mark, which gradually decreased to $87,800 over three days. Our analysis revealed that BTC has been forming lower highs and lower lows since being rejected at the $88,500 level.With the effective date for the tariffs approaching on April 2, we expect the risk sentiment to remain neutral, leading BTC to continue its sideways movement until there are notable developments on the macroeconomic front.Our analysis indicates that the cryptocurrency sector is currently experiencing a period of stagnation, with the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto assets being significantly affected by broader macroeconomic conditions. However, there is a silver lining: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is actively working to resolve a number of lawsuits involving various crypto-related projects and companies, which could pave the way for a more stable environment. Furthermore, the U.S. Senate has recently taken a significant step by voting 70-28 to repeal a controversial IRS regulation that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to collect and report taxpayer information, easing some regulatory burdens on the industry. Looking to the future, we remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency landscape and expect to see continued innovations. In particular, we are excited about the potential for advancements in the real-world assets (RWAs) and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), which we believe will be pivotal in driving the next wave of innovation.Options MarketThe above chart is the at-the-money implied volatility for BTC options with various tenors.Following the Federal Reserve's recent decision to reduce its quantitative tightening measures, we have observed a notable decline in implied volatilities (IVs) across multiple time frames. This decrease in IVs indicates the market is pricing a relatively stable period on BTC price after the dot plot suggests that the officials remain two rate cuts in 2025. Currently, the IVs for options expiring in both 7 days and 30 days have reached their lowest points in the last four months. Our team is confident that this market environment offers a prime opportunity for options traders to consider long volatility positions, enabling them to capitalize on the advantageous conditions that have arisen. Options traders can deploy straddle and strangle strategies to trade on volatility while being delta neutral.Our Option RFQ platform empowers traders to seize these opportunities with ease and efficiency.

In its announcement, the central bank voiced worries about the UK economy grappling with uncertainties tied to global trade and the risk of domestic stagnation.In the United States, initial jobless claims for the previous week stood at 223,000, with the prior figure adjusted upward from 220,000 to 221,000. This information indicates that the US labour market continues to show a degree of stability.On Monday (25-03-24)The S&P Global Manufacturing PMI for the US is expected to reach 49.8 in March, significantly below the anticipated 51.9 and February's figure of 52.7. In contrast, the S&P Global Services PMI is forecasted at 54.3, well above the predicted 51.2 and February's 51.0. The robust Services PMI indicates that the US economy remains in a strong position, easing concerns about a potential recession.On Tuesday (25-03-25)The core Consumer Price Index (CPI) from the Bank of Japan indicates an annual increase of 2.2%, consistent with the figure reported in February.In March, the US Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index fell to 92.9, down from 100.1 in February. This result was below the anticipated 94.2, implying a decline in consumer confidence among US citizens regarding their spending habits. Such a trend may result in decreased market demand, potentially alleviating inflationary pressures in the United States.On Wednesday (25-03-26)In February, the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded a monthly increase of 0.4%, slightly below the anticipated 0.5%. This resulted in an annual growth rate of 2.8%, which is lower than the expected inflation rate of 3.0%. The decline in the inflation rate has eased some of the Bank of England's concerns, raising the possibility of a rate cut by the BoE later this year. US durable goods orders are expected to show a monthly growth of 0.9% in February, an improvement compared to the predicted 1.1% decline.Later this week, attention in the market will turn to the US PCE price index data scheduled for release on Friday. This information is crucial for the Federal Reserve as it assesses inflation, significantly influencing the probability of interest rate cuts by the Fed later this year.Convert Portal Volume ChangeThe above table shows the volume change on our Convert Portal by zone. Last week, the cryptocurrency market experienced a rebound, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading above $85,000 and Solana (SOL) surpassing $140. There was significant trading interest in Binance Coin (BNB) and tokens within the BNB ecosystem, particularly DEX tokens, in the week before. Last week, the focus of the market shifted back to meme trading on the Solana network, which increased demand for Solana ($SOL) and DEX tokens associated with its ecosystem.In the Solana sector, robust trading demand resulted in a 67.3% increase in trading volume. Our desk observed a general uptick in volume for tokens within the Solana sector, with Orca ($ORCA) experiencing heightened demand last week following a price surge.In the Metaverse sector, trading volume surged by 49.9% last week, primarily driven by market interest in BurgerCities ($BURGER). The price of $BURGER experienced significant volatility, including a sharp decline of 74.1%.In the DeFi sector, trading volume rose by 30.0%, largely attributed to the strong demand for Orca ($ORCA).Why trade OTC?

Binance,"Bitcoin Faces Potential Bear Market Amid Bearish Divergence
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin (BTC) is at risk of entering a new bear market as several BTC price metrics indicate a ""bearish divergence."" On March 27, discussions on social media highlighted concerning signals from the Bitcoin Macro Index, developed by Capriole Investments. This index, introduced in 2022 by Charles Edwards, utilizes machine learning to analyze a wide range of metrics, excluding price data and technical analysis, to assess Bitcoin's relative value across historical cycles. Since late 2023, the index has been showing lower highs while BTC/USD prices have been reaching higher highs, suggesting a potential long-term peak. Edwards expressed concern over this trend but noted that he would reconsider his stance if the Bitcoin Macro Index turns positive. Bitcoin's price metrics have been struggling to recover, with various analytics sources pointing to macroeconomic challenges this year. A recent ""Quicktake"" blog post by onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant identified four onchain metrics currently in flux, indicating significant short to mid-term turbulence for Bitcoin. Contributor Burak Kesmeci noted that while these metrics suggest volatility, they do not imply that Bitcoin has reached an overheated or cycle-top level. The metrics include Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Net Unspent Profit/Loss (NUPL), and the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), which turned bearish in February. For a positive shift, Kesmeci suggested that the IFP should rise above its 90-day simple moving average (SMA).

According to BlockBeats, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on all non-U.S. manufactured vehicles. He warned that if Canada and the European Union retaliate, they will face even harsher tariffs. This strong stance has heightened market fears of an escalating trade war, overshadowing better-than-expected GDP data. Consequently, U.S. stocks fell for the second consecutive day, with the S&P 500 closing down 0.33%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.37%, and the Nasdaq declining 0.53%. The cryptocurrency market also experienced a downturn, with Bitcoin initially falling below $86,000 due to the weak opening of U.S. stocks. However, it later narrowed its losses, trading at $87,216 at the time of reporting, marking a 0.4% decline over 24 hours. Other major tokens saw slight decreases, with Ethereum fluctuating around $2,000. Overall market sentiment remains subdued, and the short-term upward potential may be limited until Trump's tariff actions become clearer. In the foreign exchange and commodities sectors, the U.S. dollar index saw a 0.25% fluctuation. A significant drop in U.S. inventories supported oil prices, but the tariff policy dampened demand expectations, weakening the upward trend in oil prices. Meanwhile, heightened risk aversion drove spot gold up by 1.23%, breaking through $3,060 to reach a historic high.",03-28-2025

Binance,"GameStop's Convertible Notes Offering Signals Bitcoin Strategy Shift
According to CoinDesk, GameStop has finalized the pricing for its previously announced private offering of $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes, marking a significant step towards incorporating bitcoin into its financial strategy. The zero-coupon notes, set to mature in 2030, will initially convert at a rate of 33.4970 shares per $1,000, translating to an initial conversion price of approximately $29.85 per share. This pricing positions the bitcoin notes at a roughly 35% premium over GameStop's most recent closing price of $22.09 at the end of Thursday's trading session in New York. GameStop's decision to integrate bitcoin into its balance sheet comes amidst a notable decline in its stock value, which fell over 22% during Thursday's trading day. This drop reflects investor skepticism regarding the company's strategic pivot towards cryptocurrency, despite CEO Ryan Cohen's efforts to leverage GameStop's substantial cash reserves through this initiative. Cohen's strategy aims to position GameStop as a significant player in the cryptocurrency space, potentially enhancing its financial standing and market influence. If the sale of these convertible notes achieves its intended targets, GameStop would emerge as the fourth largest corporate holder of bitcoin, trailing behind Riot Platforms and surpassing Tesla. This move underscores GameStop's ambition to capitalize on the growing prominence of digital currencies in the corporate sector, aligning its financial strategy with broader market trends. As the company navigates this transition, the success of its bitcoin bond strategy will be closely monitored by investors and industry analysts alike, who are keen to assess the impact of cryptocurrency integration on GameStop's future growth and stability.",03-28-2025

Binance,"Logan Paul's Defamation Lawsuit Against Coffeezilla Moves Forward
According to Cointelegraph, a Texas magistrate judge has recommended that influencer Logan Paul be allowed to proceed with his defamation lawsuit against YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, known as “Coffeezilla.” The lawsuit centers around Findeisen's remarks regarding Paul's failed CryptoZoo project. Magistrate Judge Henry Bemporad, in a report filed on March 26 in a San Antonio federal court, advised federal Judge Orlando Garcia to deny Findeisen’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. Bemporad noted that Findeisen's statements were presented more as factual claims rather than mere opinions. Paul initiated legal action against Findeisen in June, alleging that Findeisen's posts on X and two YouTube videos were malicious and caused reputational harm. CryptoZoo was intended to be a blockchain game where players could purchase NFT “eggs” that would hatch into animals, which could then be bred to create unique creatures and earn tokens based on their rarity. However, the game has yet to be realized. Paul accused Findeisen of labeling him as “a serial scammer” and describing CryptoZoo as a “scam” and a “massive con,” allegations that Paul has denied. Findeisen sought an early judgment last month, arguing that his statements were intended as opinions and that his videos included disclaimers in the description section. However, Bemporad determined that Findeisen’s statements met the legal criteria for defamation and noted that the disclaimers were not prominently displayed, being visible only when the section was expanded. Bemporad added that even if the disclaimers were more visible, they would not alter the factual nature of Findeisen’s assertions. Both Paul and Findeisen have the opportunity to object to Bemporad’s report within 14 days. Legal representatives for both parties did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of business hours. In 2022, Findeisen released three videos about CryptoZoo, which Paul did not pursue defamation claims against but had previously threatened legal action over. Paul later retracted his threats, apologized, and in January 2023, pledged to devise a plan for CryptoZoo, which materialized a year later with Paul allocating $2.3 million for refunds, provided claimants agreed not to sue over the project. Meanwhile, a group of CryptoZoo buyers has filed a class-action lawsuit against Paul and others allegedly involved in the venture, which Paul has requested to be dismissed. Additionally, he has filed a counter-suit against two business partners, whom he claims are responsible for CryptoZoo’s failure.",03-28-2025
Binance,"China Advances AI Standardization to Enhance Industry Integration
According to PANews, China's State Administration for Market Regulation is accelerating efforts to establish comprehensive national standards for the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. This initiative follows the release of the 'National AI Industry Comprehensive Standardization System Construction Guide' at the end of last year, which outlined a new phase of AI standardization planning. In 2025, several national standards have been introduced, including general requirements for AI models, evaluation metrics and methods, and service capability maturity assessments. These standards aim to lay a solid foundation for the regulated application of AI technologies. The ongoing development of national AI standards seeks to further implement the overall framework of the guide and continuously improve the national standards in the AI sector. In terms of industry application, efforts are being made to develop standards for industrial AI models and the steel industry, supporting the growth of intelligent manufacturing and the digital transformation of traditional industries. Additionally, application standards are being developed for sectors such as healthcare, home living, and transportation, promoting the deep integration of AI with various industries.

The development of standards for AI application safety classification, capability maturity assessment, and ethical governance is also being strengthened to ensure the safe and reliable use of AI technologies.",03-28-2025
Binance,"EU to Impose Fines on Apple and Meta Under Digital Markets Act

Meta will also face penalties and be instructed to alter its 'pay or agree' model, which forces users to either consent to data tracking or pay for an ad-free experience. Under antitrust laws, companies could face fines up to 10% of their global revenue, potentially resulting in billions of dollars in penalties for both firms.

According to Odaily, Canary Capital has recently submitted multiple applications for altcoin ETFs, sparking discussions within the community about whether this is merely a marketing tactic.

He explained that early investments aim to secure a first-mover advantage, citing HBAR as a stable token that has not yet attracted attention from other ETF issuers.

Binance,"EU Proposes Strict Capital Requirements for Crypto Holdings in Insurance Sector
According to Cointelegraph, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) has proposed a stringent regulation requiring insurance firms to maintain capital equivalent to their crypto holdings. This measure aims to mitigate risks for policyholders and sets a higher standard compared to other asset classes like stocks and real estate, which do not require full backing. EIOPA's Technical Advice report to the European Commission on March 27 suggests a 100% haircut in the standard formula for crypto assets, citing their inherent risks and high volatility. The proposal seeks to address a regulatory gap between the Capital Requirements Regulation and Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), as the current EU framework for insurers lacks specific provisions for crypto assets. EIOPA presented four options for the European Commission's consideration: no changes, an 80% stress level, a 100% stress level, or a broader consideration of tokenized assets. EIOPA favors the third option, arguing that an 80% stress level is insufficiently prudent, while a 100% stress aligns with transitional treatment approaches under CRR. The 100% stress level assumes crypto asset prices could fall entirely, with diversification failing to mitigate this risk. EIOPA highlighted past declines in Bitcoin and Ether, which fell 82% and 91%, respectively. This approach contrasts with capital charges for stocks, ranging from 39% to 49%, and real estate, at 25%, as per the Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/35. EIOPA believes a 100% capital charge for crypto asset-related insurance undertakings would not be overly burdensome and would not impose material costs on policyholders. The capital requirements aim to fully capture crypto asset risks, positively impacting policyholder protection. Despite the immaterial share of crypto asset-related insurance undertakings, accounting for just 655 million euros or 0.0068% of all undertakings in Europe, EIOPA emphasizes the high-risk nature of crypto investments, which could result in total value loss. Luxembourg and Sweden are expected to be most affected by the proposed rule, with these countries accounting for 69% and 21% of all crypto asset-related exposures among insurance undertakings. Ireland, Denmark, and Liechtenstein also have notable exposures. Most of these undertakings are structured within funds, such as exchange-traded funds, and held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders. EIOPA acknowledges that broader crypto asset adoption may necessitate a more differentiated approach in the future.",03-28-2025

Binance,"OpenAI Implements Rate Limits Amid Viral AI Art Trend
According to Cointelegraph, OpenAI has introduced rate limits following a viral trend on social media that transformed various images into AI art inspired by the renowned Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was among the first to participate in this trend, sharing a portrait of himself generated by the model on March 25. However, he later announced that the surge in image requests was straining the company's infrastructure. Altman expressed his excitement over the popularity of the images generated by ChatGPT but acknowledged the challenges posed by the increased demand. ""It’s super fun seeing people love images in ChatGPT, but our GPUs are melting. We are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient,"" he stated. He also mentioned that some image generations were being incorrectly refused and assured users that these issues were being addressed promptly. OpenAI's upgraded image generation feature in ChatGPT-4o, launched on March 25, has led to a widespread sharing of images in the Studio Ghibli art style, known for iconic anime films like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro. While Altman did not specify how long the rate limits would remain in place, he expressed hope for a swift resolution, indicating that the ChatGPT free tier would soon allow three generations per day. OpenAI explained that rate limits are necessary to manage the overall load on its infrastructure, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience for all users. The company noted that a dramatic increase in API requests could strain servers and lead to performance issues, making rate limits a crucial measure. The trend has attracted widespread participation, including notable figures such as X and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who shared an image resembling King Mufasa from Disney’s The Lion King holding a Shiba Inu. Additionally, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks joined in by using the Studio Ghibli art style for an image of himself at an event. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on March 26 that OpenAI anticipates more than tripling its revenue this year to $12.7 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. Altman also mentioned plans to release GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 in the coming weeks or months, signaling continued advancements in AI technology.",03-28-2025

Users will soon pay for groceries or coffee directly with $THE tokens—no banks needed.”The vision is to remove entry barriers into DeFi with seamless fiat onramps, smart spending tools, and accessible financial products—cementing THENA’s role in mainstream adoption.THENA x Venus Protocol: A Soft Merger to Create the DeFAI SuperApp“We’ve officially submitted our merger proposal to Venus DAO,” confirms 0xApollo. “If passed, we’ll unify our DEX with Venus’s lending and borrowing protocols, integrating AI automation from Singularry and Web3 banking from Enfineo.”This all-in-one DeFi suite will let users trade, lend, and manage assets within one app—marking a leap forward in usability and financial sovereignty.THENA’s Korea Strategy and Beyond“Our Korean journey began with CoinEasy, followed by our ETH Seoul 2024 presence,” 0xApollo says. “Now, after a major CEX listing in Korea, we’re scaling educational outreach and localized support.”THENA aims to serve Korea’s tech-savvy market through tailored events, community engagement, and educational materials that demystify DeFi for all user levels.Building Community, One Sprint at a TimeFrom Zealy Sprints to an upcoming Ambassador Program, THENA ensures its community stays at the heart of the project. “Our ambassadors will lead regional growth, educate users, and amplify THENA’s reach,” says 0xApollo.  ﻿ ﻿The team continues to incentivize contributions through contests, content creation, and educational missions—fueling one of the most dynamic ecosystems in DeFi.Security First: How THENA Protects Its UsersSecurity is non-negotiable for THENA. With audits, Hypernative’s real-time monitoring, and upgraded internal security after a Telegram incident, the team remains vigilant. “We’ve never been hacked—and we plan to keep it that way,” assures 0xApollo.Overcoming Challenges and Planning for Sustainable Growth“Our biggest challenge? Budget constraints,” says 0xApollo. “But we’ve made it work. ETH Denver cost us just $10K—yet delivered massive impact.”To scale, THENA is expanding into Singapore, seeking institutional capital, and onboarding new developers. It’s a growth story built on efficiency, not excess.THENA’s Vision for DeFi and the Road Ahead0xApollo believes DeFi is on the brink of mass adoption. “Compared to the 2021 bull run, today’s DeFi is mature. Regulatory clarity and real-world utility are changing the game.”By blending usability, cross-chain functionality, and tangible financial tools, THENA is poised to be a catalyst in DeFi’s mainstream rise.Top Blockchain Sectors to Watch in 2025When asked about trends for 2025, 0xApollo points to two standouts:DeFi’s institutional evolutionTokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs)“RWAs will democratize finance by unlocking trillions in value.

According to PANews, OpenAI's newly launched image generation tool, GPT-4o, can produce images in the ""Studio Ghibli style,"" while the free version of ChatGPT, equipped with DALL-E 3, declines similar requests due to copyright policies. When a journalist attempted to generate Studio Ghibli-style images using the free ChatGPT, the response indicated that such images could not be created because the animation studio is protected by copyright. However, the paid version of ChatGPT, utilizing the GPT-4o tool, successfully generates these images. An OpenAI spokesperson explained that the new system restricts image generation in the styles of ""living artists"" but permits the creation of images in ""broader studio styles."" Despite Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki being alive, this situation appears to fall under the ""studio style"" category, allowing GPT-4o to generate Ghibli-style images without restriction. It remains unclear whether OpenAI has adjusted its copyright policy or reached a content agreement with Studio Ghibli. Neither OpenAI nor Studio Ghibli has commented on the matter. This incident has raised questions about OpenAI's copyright policy and its perceived double standards, while also potentially encouraging more users to upgrade to the paid version of ChatGPT.",03-28-2025

Binance,"AI Models Enhance Accuracy in Financial and Legal Applications
According to PANews, the deployment of AI large language models (LLMs) in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and law faces significant challenges due to the ""hallucination"" problem, where AI outputs may not match the precision required in these fields. Mira Network has introduced a public test network offering a solution to this issue. AI LLMs often exhibit hallucinations due to two main reasons: incomplete training data, which leads to creative completions in niche or specialized areas, and reliance on probabilistic sampling, which identifies statistical patterns rather than true understanding, causing inconsistencies in handling high-precision factual queries. A study published on Cornell University's ArXiv platform proposes a method to enhance the reliability of LLM outputs through multi-model verification. This approach involves generating results with a primary model and then using multiple verification models for majority vote analysis, reducing hallucinations and increasing accuracy to 95.6%. Mira Network has developed a distributed verification platform to manage and verify interactions between primary and verification models. This middleware network provides a reliable validation layer between users and foundational AI models, enabling services such as privacy protection, accuracy assurance, scalable design, and standardized API interfaces. By minimizing AI LLM hallucinations, Mira Network expands AI's applicability across various specialized scenarios. Examples of Mira Network's application include: 1) Gigabrain, a trading platform, integrates Mira to verify market analysis and prediction accuracy, filtering unreliable suggestions and enhancing AI trading signals' reliability in DeFi scenarios. 2) Learnrite uses Mira to validate AI-generated standardized exam questions, allowing educational institutions to utilize AI-generated content without compromising test accuracy, maintaining strict educational standards. 3) The blockchain Kernel project incorporates Mira's LLM consensus mechanism into the BNB ecosystem, creating a decentralized verification network (DVN) that ensures the accuracy and security of AI computations on the blockchain. Mira Network offers a middleware consensus network service, which is not the sole method to enhance AI application capabilities. Other options include data-driven training enhancements, multimodal model interactions, and privacy computing enhancements through cryptographic technologies like ZKP, FHE, and TEE. However, Mira's solution is notable for its rapid implementation and immediate effectiveness.",03-28-2025

Binance,"Crypto's Development Mirrors Early Internet Era, Says Polygon Co-Founder
According to Cointelegraph, the current state of cryptocurrency is comparable to the ""America Online"" (AOL) era of the internet in the late 1990s, characterized by a cumbersome user experience and limited use cases. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal highlighted this analogy, noting that the crypto industry is still in its early stages, akin to the dial-up era of the internet. Nailwal emphasized the need for advancements in several areas to enhance user experience, such as seamless fiat on- and off-ramps, key recovery solutions for custody, and the integration of hardware wallets into mobile devices. Nailwal remarked that the crypto industry is likely in a phase similar to 1998, suggesting it could take another 10 to 15 years for cryptocurrencies to reach their full potential. During the AOL days, the internet was primarily used for email and basic web browsing, with a high barrier to entry. Today, the internet has evolved to encompass the entire economy. Nailwal believes that the current focus of crypto on financial use cases, particularly market speculation, mirrors the early internet's limited functionality. He anticipates that once financial use cases are fully developed and widely adopted, cryptocurrencies will expand into alternative sectors such as decentralized social media, gaming, and other niche areas. Nailwal also pointed out that even the fundamental financial use case of cryptocurrencies has not been fully realized. A report from Bitcoin financial services company River, published in February 2025, revealed that only 4% of individuals worldwide own Bitcoin (BTC), the original cryptocurrency with the largest market cap. The report indicated that BTC has achieved only about 3% of its total adoption potential when considering institutions, the total addressable market, and proper portfolio allocations. This low percentage of BTC holders suggests that mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is still years away, and the industry remains in the early adopter phase of development.",03-27-2025

According to Cointelegraph, Tether has expanded its crosschain US-dollar stablecoin, USDT0, to Optimism's Superchain, enhancing access to the widely used stable asset within Ethereum's layer-2 ecosystem. On March 27, Optimism announced the deployment of the dollar-pegged USDT0 on the OP mainnet. Initially launched on Ink, Kraken's DeFi-focused layer-2, USDT0 is a bridged version of Tether's USDt (USDT) aimed at increasing stablecoin adoption across multiple blockchains. Tether introduced USDT0 in January in partnership with the interoperability protocol LayerZero, and subsequently selected Arbitrum as the primary infrastructure provider. Superchain, a network of layer-2 chains, is designed to scale Ethereum using Optimism's OP Stack. Currently, it accounts for 52% of Ethereum layer-2 transactions, as per data from Superchain. Since September, Superchain's dominance in the L2 space has grown from 36.6% to 51.9% of all transactions. In February, Optimism's chief growth officer, Ryan Wyatt, indicated that Superchain could represent 80% of Ethereum L2 transactions by the end of the year. At that time, Superchain had secured over $4 billion in total value, a figure that has since increased to $4.2 billion. The deployment of USDT0 is anticipated to attract more top-tier assets, applications, and partners to Superchain, underscoring the significant role stablecoins play in driving DeFi adoption. The total value of all stablecoins in circulation has reached nearly $228 billion, marking a 3.3% increase over the past month. According to RWA.xyz, there are over 155 million stablecoin holders globally, with Ethereum accounting for 58% of the total stablecoin supply. In terms of market capitalization, Ethereum remains the largest network for stablecoins, with Tether's USDt being the most widely used stable asset. Tether has maintained a first-mover advantage in the stablecoin market and has become one of the largest holders of US Treasury assets, contributing to its substantial profits in recent years.

Binance,"Russian Economist Warns Against Establishing National Crypto Reserve
According to ShibDaily, Valentin Katasonov, Chairman of the S. F. Sharapov Russian Economic Society and a Doctor of Economics, has expressed concerns over Russia's potential establishment of a national cryptocurrency reserve. Katasonov argues that cryptocurrencies are speculative assets rather than legitimate forms of money, posing significant risks to economic stability. He likened the idea of a national crypto reserve to ""laying landmines"" in the economy, warning that if the speculative bubble bursts, it could lead to widespread economic damage. Katasonov's skepticism is shared by Russia's Central Bank Governor, Elvira Nabiullina, who has proposed a ban on crypto transactions between residents, allowing them only within a controlled legal framework. This reflects the government's cautious stance on digital assets. Katasonov also criticized proponents of integrating cryptocurrency into Russia's official economic system, suggesting they might be part of a ""fifth column"" aiming to undermine the country's financial security. He noted that while some countries, including the United States, have considered establishing Bitcoin reserves, the concept remains largely theoretical. In contrast, U.S. President Donald Trump recently signed an Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, funded by cryptocurrency seized in government criminal cases. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to manage digital assets within the nation's financial framework, emphasizing secure handling and long-term management. Federal agencies have been directed to report on their digital asset holdings and assess their authority to transfer seized assets into these reserves. The Department of the Treasury is reviewing the economic and legal implications of maintaining such reserves and may propose further legislation.

Binance,"South Korean Officials Reveal Significant Crypto Holdings
According to Cointelegraph, South Korea's Ethics Commission has disclosed that high-ranking public officials in the country possess an average of 35.1 million won ($24,000) in cryptocurrency assets. On March 27, the commission reported that over 20% of surveyed officials hold a total of 14.4 billion won ($9.8 million) in digital currencies. This revelation indicates that 411 out of 2,047 officials required to disclose their assets have invested in cryptocurrencies. Among them, Seoul City Councilor Kim Hye-young reported the highest amount, with holdings worth 1.76 billion won ($1.2 million). The officials' crypto portfolios include various assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Luna Classic (LUNC), and others. The disclosure of these crypto holdings comes amid increasing demands for transparency from South Korea's leadership. In 2023, Prime Minister Han Deok-soo emphasized the need for high-ranking government officials to include cryptocurrencies in their property disclosures, equating them with other assets like precious metals. Consequently, on May 25, 2023, South Korea enacted legislation requiring public officials to report their crypto holdings. This law, effective from 2024, allows South Koreans to access information about the crypto assets of at least 5,800 public officials. Furthermore, in June 2024, crypto exchanges in South Korea introduced systems to facilitate the registration of crypto holdings, streamlining the disclosure process. The push for transparency was partly fueled by a controversy involving lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk, who faced accusations of liquidating and concealing crypto assets worth approximately $4.5 million. This incident occurred before the enforcement of the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""Travel Rule"" in South Korea. Amid the legal proceedings, Kim resigned from the Democratic Party to alleviate the pressure on his colleagues. Although prosecutors sought a six-month prison sentence, Kim was acquitted after a judge determined that crypto assets were not subject to disclosure requirements at the time of his transactions. This case highlighted the need for clear regulations regarding the disclosure of digital assets by public officials.",03-27-2025

Binance,"Dubai's Crypto Regulation Advances with VARA's Strategic Approach
According to CoinDesk, the landscape of crypto regulation has significantly evolved, with digital assets now having dedicated regulatory bodies in many regions. Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) stands out as a pioneer in this space, known for its effective communication of guidelines to crypto firms. Sean McHugh, VARA's senior director of market assurance, emphasized the importance of feedback and open channels in the regulatory process, stating that their exclusive focus on crypto allows for deeper engagement with the technology and modern-era rule-making. Dubai has emerged as a favored destination for non-native crypto firms seeking to establish a presence in the region. McHugh noted that Dubai serves as a strategic entry point for firms from Europe and Asia, with regulatory clarity being a significant draw. The city's proactive approach to regulation is further exemplified by its initiatives in real-world tokenization. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has launched a pilot project to register and transfer property deeds on the blockchain, supported by VARA and the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF). This integration of real estate into blockchain technology is expected to significantly impact Dubai's property market, with DLD projecting tokenized real estate to reach 60 billion dirhams ($16 billion) by 2033, accounting for 7% of total property transactions. McHugh highlighted the growing popularity of tokenization projects, not just in real estate but also in precious metals. VARA's agile regulatory approach focuses on customer protection, particularly in fractionalization, which attracts new capital and retail investors. McHugh stressed the importance of understanding the specifics of RWA projects, including the nature of the token, ownership details, trading mechanisms, and liquidity providers, to ensure investor protection. In the broader context of global crypto regulation, McHugh pointed out the importance of interagency collaboration. While the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has been a vocal advocate for crypto, VARA's establishment predates this support, reflecting the UAE's independent regulatory trajectory. McHugh does not foresee a single regulatory body leading the global charge but advocates for memoranda of understanding and open communication between agencies as essential for effective oversight. The future of crypto in Dubai appears promising, driven by the city's pro-business and start-up-friendly environment, as noted by McHugh, who previously served as chief compliance officer at Citadel.",03-27-2025
Binance,"Crypto Market Shows Bearish Trend Amid Funding Rate Analysis
According to BlockBeats, data from Coinglass indicates that the current funding rates across major centralized and decentralized exchanges suggest a bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. The funding rates for key cryptocurrencies are detailed in the analysis. Funding rates are fees set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between contract prices and the prices of underlying assets, typically applied to perpetual contracts. This mechanism facilitates the exchange of funds between long and short traders, without the platform charging this fee, to adjust the cost or profit of holding contracts, ensuring contract prices remain close to the asset prices. A funding rate of 0.01% signifies a baseline rate. When the funding rate exceeds 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market sentiment. Conversely, a funding rate below 0.005% reflects a bearish market outlook.",03-27-2025

Binance,"Exploring the Potential of NFTs in Digital Innovation
According to PANews, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a significant topic in the digital era, often likened to unique items in the digital world with characteristics similar to those in the physical realm. NFTs can simulate three core features: provenance, exclusivity, and modifiability, which are not typically found in ordinary digital items. In the art sector, NFTs have primarily utilized provenance and exclusivity. For instance, Botto's artwork ""Asymmetrical Liberation"" uses NFT technology to verify its origin as Botto's first creation, granting the holder exclusive control. However, like physical art, owners cannot alter the artwork itself. The exploration of modifiability in NFTs is limited, with gaming NFTs being the closest application, where players upgrade characters. This feature remains underappreciated. A more innovative application involves using NFTs for smart agents, digital assistants that remember user interactions, showcasing the three core NFT features: Exclusivity: NFT holders have exclusive access to the agent's memory. Modifiability: The agent's memory updates with each use, accumulating unique experiences and adjustments. Provenance: The agent's usage history reflects its experience accumulation, akin to a resume. For example, if renowned author Tolkien used a smart agent to write ""The Hobbit,"" it would hold unique value for aspiring fantasy writers due to its accumulated experience. This experience is unique and non-replicable. While most agents may serve as public-facing API services similar to SaaS products, smart agent NFTs resemble racehorses, deriving value from their trainers and retaining training results, with only one owner at a time. Companies like Plastic Labs are developing underlying technology to support such smart agent NFTs. This innovative approach of combining NFTs with smart agents expands the application boundaries of digital assets and introduces new design concepts in software development and artificial intelligence. As technology advances, more personalized and marketable smart agent applications may emerge.",03-27-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Bitcoin Breaks 3-Month Downtrend as GameStop News and Technicals Signal Bullish Shift
Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a three-month downtrend on the daily chart, marking a pivotal shift in market structure even as U.S. trading hours on March 26 saw renewed selling pressure. BTC briefly dipped below $87,000 following a weak open in U.S. equities and a rise in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which hit a three-week high of 104.46.U.S. Trading, Dollar Strength Spark Sell-OffBTC/USD had traded steadily during Asian hours but mimicked U.S. stock market weakness once Wall Street opened. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both turned red, weighing on risk assets, while the rising dollar added further downside pressure to BTC.“Uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and the broader political landscape remains front of mind,” said QCP Capital, referencing President Trump’s upcoming April 2 tariff measures that are keeping markets on edge.Despite this macro pressure, QCP remains tactically bullish on Bitcoin, particularly after GameStop’s announcement of adding BTC to its corporate treasury.“The symbolic weight of GME’s meme status could rekindle speculative fervor among retail participants,” QCP added. “Retail flows, if coordinated, have the power to challenge institutional positioning.”Technical Breakout Signals Bullish MomentumOn the technical front, Titan of Crypto, a well-known trader, noted that BTC has broken out of a descending channel that’s capped price action for the past three months.“BTC has just broken out of a 3-month descending channel, signaling a key shift in market structure,” he wrote on X, attaching a breakout chart.This structural breakout aligns with two other key bullish indicators this week:Relative Strength Index (RSI): Showing renewed upward momentum.Hash Ribbon Metric: Signaling miner capitulation is over, historically a bullish cue.Market Sentiment & OutlookWhile Bitcoin’s short-term momentum remains mixed—given low volume and macroeconomic headwinds—the combination of structural breakout, improving on-chain signals, and rising institutional interest suggests upside potential may soon follow.The market will closely watch upcoming developments including:Trump’s tariff rollouts on April 2Reaction to GameStop’s BTC allocationContinued ETF inflows and regulatory updatesBitcoin’s breakout from its 3-month downtrend could be the early confirmation of a new bullish phase, provided macro conditions stabilize and speculative interest from retail investors resurfaces.

Binance,"Dogecoin News: Dogecoin Price Eyes 55% Rally as Key Support Holds, Momentum Builds
Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged 18% in just three days, outperforming the top 30 cryptocurrencies and sparking renewed interest from traders and analysts alike. With DOGE currently trading at $0.1965, one key trend suggests the meme coin could be poised for a 55% rally—if the critical $0.20 support level holds.Onchain Metrics Point to a Breakout ZoneAccording to Glassnode data, 7% of the total DOGE supply is clustered at the $0.20 level. This URPD (Unrealized Price Distribution) metric helps identify areas of potential support or resistance based on where coins were last moved.“If $0.20 is breached, there’s little Dogecoin supply until $0.31,” said Glassnode, adding that the lack of resistance in this range significantly raises the chance for a sharp price surge.DOGE’s price action suggests that a breakout toward $0.31 could pave the way for a larger bullish structure to form on the high time frame (HTF) charts.  DOGE Breaks Key Trendline, Sentiment Turns BullishOn March 24, DOGE broke out of a three-month descending trendline, a move flagged by crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade as a bullish signal.“The token looks set for a relief rally over the next few days,” said Tardigrade.Adding to bullish sentiment, the House of Doge—the Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate wing—announced the launch of The Official Dogecoin Reserve, kicking off with a 10 million DOGE purchase aimed at building a more stable payments ecosystem.“With a strategic reserve, House of Doge is laying the foundation for a payments ecosystem that ensures liquidity, stability, and reliability,” the Foundation stated. They also pledged to provide full transparency once the reserve transaction is completed.Resistance and Sell Zones AheadBeyond the $0.31 target, DOGE faces potential resistance in the $0.32–$0.41 zone, where 3 to 6-month HODL waves sit. These levels coincide with investor entry points from January 2025, which could lead to profit-taking or breakeven selling pressure.If DOGE can maintain support at $0.20 and trading volume continues to rise, analysts believe a 55% rally toward $0.31 is within reach. The breakout of a long-standing downtrend and the new institutional initiative from the House of Doge are fueling optimism that the meme coin may be gearing up for a strong short-term rally, according to Cointelegraph.",03-27-2025

Binance,"XRP News: XRP Faces Potential 55% Drop if Bearish Pattern Confirms, Says Peter Brandt — But Not All Analysts Agree
XRP is under pressure once again, falling 4.7% over the past week despite bullish sentiment in broader crypto markets fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to $88,800. The altcoin’s trading volume has also declined by 35%, dropping from $4 billion to $2.6 billion, further signaling weakening momentum after its brief 11% surge on March 19 following the resolution of Ripple’s SEC lawsuit.Head and Shoulders Warning: Could XRP Plunge to $1.07?Veteran trader Peter Brandt issued a stark warning this week, identifying a “textbook” head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern forming on XRP’s chart. If confirmed, Brandt says the bearish structure could push the token’s price down to $1.07, a potential 55% correction from current levels.“Below $1.90, I would not want to own it. H&S projects to $1.07. Don’t shoot the messenger,” Brandt noted on X.He added that a rally above $3 would invalidate the pattern and restore bullish momentum.Not Everyone Is Bearish: Falling Wedge Breakout in FocusContrary to Brandt’s outlook, crypto trader Javon Marks sees a more optimistic setup. He pointed to XRP’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern, supported by a strengthening Relative Strength Index (RSI)—a combination historically followed by large price increases.“The last breakout resulted in a roughly +570% price increase, and prices could be ready for another substantial surge,” Marks stated.Key Levels: $2.50 Resistance & $1.90 SupportTechnically, XRP has managed to hold above the crucial $1.90 support level, which has acted as a buying zone since November 2024. The altcoin has yet to post a daily close below this threshold, indicating ongoing investor interest.“We need to see clear breaks of the levels I have shown. Just be aware of the next week or two, as the price action will be telling,” said order flow analyst Dom.For bulls, $2.50 remains a critical resistance to reclaim, having served as both support and resistance over the past four months.OutlookXRP’s short-term trajectory remains uncertain as the market digests conflicting technical signals. A drop below $1.90 could open the door for steep losses toward $1.07, while holding this level—especially with a breakout above $2.50—could signal the start of a larger bullish trend.XRP is at a technical crossroads. Traders should watch the $1.90 and $2.50 levels closely, as the next two weeks are likely to determine the altcoin’s direction, according to Cointelegraph.",03-27-2025

Binance,"Ethereum News: Ethereum Eyes $2.5K Recovery as Fundamentals Strengthen Ahead of Pectra Upgrade
Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed the $2,000 support level, fueling optimism for a potential rebound to $2,500—despite trailing behind its altcoin peers by 14% over the past month. As bearish sentiment fades, three core fundamentals are emerging as catalysts for ETH’s recovery: the upcoming Pectra upgrade, a growing total value locked (TVL), and shrinking exchange supply.Pectra Upgrade Could Be a Game ChangerEthereum’s long-awaited Pectra network upgrade, expected between late April and early June, could mark a pivotal moment in its scalability roadmap. Key upgrades include:Doubling block data capacity to reduce rollup and privacy mechanism fees.Higher call data costs to incentivize the adoption of more efficient data storage via blobs.Smart accounts that offer enhanced user experience through gas fee sponsorship and passkey-based authentication.These improvements are aimed at improving Ethereum's base-layer efficiency, addressing long-standing criticisms related to high gas fees and poor scalability. Ethereum TVL Surges, Exchanges See ETH OutflowsEthereum’s DeFi ecosystem continues to show strength:TVL hits $52.5B, outpacing Solana’s $7B.ETH deposits grew 10% in the past 30 days, with standout performances from protocols like Ethena (+38%) and Sky (formerly Maker, +17%).At the same time, Ethereum exchange balances fell to 16.9M ETH, just 3.5% above a five-year low—suggesting long-term holding behavior and reduced sell-side pressure.Institutional Interest: A Quiet but Growing TrendEthereum remains the only altcoin with a U.S.-based spot ETF, currently managing $8.9B AUM. While recent ETF inflows have been muted—compared to $316M in net outflows since March 10—the growing narrative around Ethereum’s role in Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization may spark renewed interest.Notably, BlackRock’s BUILD fund, built on Ethereum, recently surpassed $1.5B in capitalization, reinforcing Ethereum's leadership in institutional-grade DeFi infrastructure. The Ethereum ecosystem now represents over 80% of the RWA market, per RWA.XYZ data.ETH to $2.5K? Momentum Builds, But Traders Remain CautiousDespite Arthur Hayes’ bold $5,000 price target for ETH, options markets remain skeptical, with $5K calls priced at just $35.40—implying low odds. However, the combination of infrastructure improvements, TVL expansion, and declining liquid supply suggests ETH may be preparing for a slow and steady climb.If Pectra rolls out as scheduled and user experience improves significantly, Ethereum could retest the $2.5K level in the near term—setting the stage for a stronger Q2 performance.Bottom Line: Ethereum’s fundamentals are aligning for a potential breakout, but the market still awaits a decisive shift in sentiment and institutional inflows to sustain a climb beyond $2,500.",03-27-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin News: Will GameStop’s Bitcoin Bet Help Push BTC to $200K? Experts Say It’s Not Enough—Yet
GameStop’s latest move to allocate part of its $4.77 billion cash reserve into Bitcoin has reignited speculation around whether the meme stock-turned-digital-asset adopter can help push BTC past the elusive $100K mark—and ultimately to the coveted $200K milestone. But while the announcement adds fuel to Bitcoin’s long-term bullish narrative, analysts warn the current environment lacks the institutional muscle and infrastructure needed to trigger such explosive gains.GameStop Joins Bitcoin’s Corporate Treasury MovementGameStop now joins a growing list of publicly traded firms adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Following the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR), Japan’s Metaplanet, and mining giant MARA Holdings, the company’s pivot is seen as a bold statement of confidence in BTC as a hedge and value store.Despite this momentum—and Donald Trump’s recent executive order encouraging “budget-neutral” BTC acquisitions—Bitcoin has been unable to reclaim $100K, trading around $86,900 and struggling to break out for over 50 days.Strong Corporate Demand, But Weak InfrastructureWhile GameStop’s decision adds to the growing list of corporate Bitcoin holders, analysts say that a few high-profile treasury buys aren’t enough to spark a parabolic move to $200K.One key reason: integration with the traditional financial (TradFi) system is still lacking.Bitcoin ETFs remain cash-settled, limiting tax efficiency and preventing physical BTC inflows.Major banks and brokers—like JPMorgan, Vanguard, and BNY Mellon—still restrict access to spot BTC ETFs and crypto exposure.Derivatives markets lack regulatory clarity, with offshore exchanges dominating trading volume, raising red flags for risk-averse institutional players.Gold Outperforms BTC Despite Positive News FlowInterestingly, despite favorable crypto headlines, gold has outperformed Bitcoin in recent weeks, trading just 1.3% below its all-time high at $3,057. This highlights a disconnect between crypto market narratives and actual price action—driven by investor uncertainty and the lack of capital inflows from TradFi institutions.Regulatory Uncertainty Still Clouding Institutional AdoptionEven with recent wins like the SEC’s SAB 121 repeal and the proposed Bitcoin Reserve program under Trump, the crypto space still suffers from reputational and regulatory friction:Major crypto exchanges like Binance and Kraken have faced large fines for AML violations.Wealth managers remain restricted from offering BTC to clients, limiting exposure from traditional portfolios.Why Bitcoin May Not Reach $200K Anytime SoonWhile GameStop’s BTC buy is symbolically bullish, price action is driven by capital—not just headlines. And with the Bitcoin derivatives market still largely inaccessible to U.S. institutions, the weight of risk perception, regulatory bottlenecks, and the absence of a unified financial on-ramp keep BTC price growth in check.“Until meaningful integration with the banking sector happens, BTC’s upside will remain capped,” analysts note.GameStop’s BTC purchase is a step forward—but not a catalyst. Without a significant shift in TradFi infrastructure, ETF structures, and institutional access, Bitcoin may remain rangebound below six figures in the near term.For BTC to hit $200K, more than a meme stock’s endorsement is needed—it will take regulatory clarity, seamless institutional access, and a deeper market infrastructure that’s still in development, according to Cointelegraph.",03-27-2025

Bitcoin (BTC) erased overnight gains and dipped below $87,000 during Wednesday’s U.S. trading hours, despite a high-profile announcement from GameStop revealing plans to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. The sharp reversal came as broader market sentiment weakened across risk assets, and crypto bulls were left questioning the bullishness of the move.Key Highlights:BTC fell 3% from its overnight peak of nearly $89,000, currently trading around $86,500.The CoinDesk 20 Index dropped 1.9%, with ETH, SOL, and AAVE each down between 3%-4%.U.S. equities also declined, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% and the Nasdaq off 1.6%, as macroeconomic concerns took center stage.GameStop (GME) jumped 16% Tuesday after announcing its Bitcoin strategy, but the rally failed to inspire sustained gains in BTC.Market Caution Overrides HypeDespite what many in crypto expected to be a bullish catalyst, Bitcoin’s price retreated swiftly following the GameStop announcement. The plan, which remains vague in terms of allocation size and timeline, did not generate enough momentum to break past resistance at $89,000.“Zombie companies like GameStop ‘pulling a Saylor’ as a get-out-of-jail card would be a clear topping signal,” warned analyst James Check, referencing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model that helped lead the last bull cycle. Check suggested that struggling public companies buying Bitcoin as a last resort could be more of a red flag than a bullish signal.Macro Pressure ReturnsThe pullback comes amid renewed macroeconomic uncertainty:Debt ceiling concerns resurfaced after the Congressional Budget Office warned that the U.S. could run out of money by August if the debt limit isn't raised.Tariff tensions also weigh on investor confidence as Trump's reciprocal tariff policies are expected to kick in on April 2.Hedge fund QCP Capital noted in a broadcast that “uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and the broader political landscape remains front of mind.”Until clarity emerges, QCP expects continued sideways volatility across risk markets.Bullish Catalyst or Top Signal?While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook helped spark institutional adoption, analysts are divided on whether GameStop’s move carries the same weight:Anthony Pompliano believes GameStop’s treasury move could be material if it allocates a significant portion of its $4.8B in cash.Critics argue that copycat strategies from companies with questionable fundamentals may actually indicate market overexuberance.Bottom Line: GameStop’s Bitcoin pivot was met with excitement — but not market conviction. With macro headwinds, debt ceiling fears, and tariff uncertainties clouding the outlook, BTC’s rally remains fragile, and the road to $90K may require stronger catalysts and firmer institutional confidence, according o CoinDesk.",03-26-2025
Binance,"Crypto News Today: Banks Reduce Direct Crypto Exposure, Favor Regulated Exchange-Traded Products
Global banks are significantly reducing their exposure to spot cryptocurrencies, shifting their focus to more regulated exchange-traded products (ETPs), according to fresh data from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The move signals a growing preference for traditional financial instruments over direct crypto holdings as regulatory pressure mounts.Key Highlights:$368.3 billion in crypto assets were under custody by 29 banks in Q2 2024.Only 2.46% of bank holdings were in spot crypto — down sharply from prior years.92.5% of crypto holdings now come via regulated exchange-traded products (ETPs).The shift follows 2023’s banking turmoil, including the collapse of Signature and Silicon Valley Bank.From Crypto Custody to ETP DominanceAs of June 2024, 29 global banks were responsible for the reported €341.5 billion ($368.3 billion) in crypto asset custody. However, the vast majority of these holdings were not in actual cryptocurrencies, but in exchange-traded products (ETPs) — funds that track the price of crypto assets and are considered safer under existing regulatory frameworks.The Basel Committee, which sets international banking standards, reported that just 2.46% of these holdings were in spot crypto assets, with the remaining over 92% in ETPs. This marks a sharp decline in spot exposure — down more than 44% since 2021.Why the Shift?The decline in direct crypto holdings aligns with a December 2022 BCBS recommendation that banks should limit spot crypto exposure to below 2% of their total assets. The move also comes in the wake of banking failures tied to crypto exposure in 2023, prompting regulators to scrutinize financial institutions more closely.Banks are reacting by reducing risk, moving toward regulated, transparent instruments like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, many of which have gained approval across the U.S. and Europe over the past year.Global Financial Oversight TightensThe BCBS’s survey, involving 176 banks (115 internationally active), reflects a broader global trend: financial institutions are minimizing direct crypto interaction while still offering exposure to digital assets via regulated channels.This shift mirrors moves by traditional asset managers and pension funds that are increasingly favoring spot Bitcoin ETFs and structured crypto offerings, particularly as regulatory clarity improves in key jurisdictions.What It Means for Crypto MarketsWhile banks are pulling away from spot crypto, the surge in ETP adoption could enhance institutional involvement and boost market legitimacy. This trend also underlines the growing divide between decentralized finance (DeFi) and regulated TradFi adoption paths.The future of crypto in traditional finance appears to rest on compliant infrastructure and regulated access points — with banks playing a backseat role to funds, ETFs, and custodians, according to CoinDesk.",03-26-2025

GameStop (GME) stock soared 16% on Wednesday following its announcement to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins as part of its balance sheet strategy, setting off a wave of speculation across financial and crypto communities.Key Highlights:GameStop plans to allocate a portion of its $4.8 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin and USD-denominated stablecoins.The company has not disclosed how much Bitcoin it plans to buy or when the purchases will begin.CEO Ryan Cohen and Strive Asset Management’s Matt Cole had hinted at the pivot weeks earlier.GME Shares Rally on Bitcoin BetThe gaming retailer revealed the crypto play during its Q4 earnings call on Tuesday, sparking a 16% spike in GME shares by Wednesday morning. The news came as a surprise given the company's silence on details, but the announcement alone was enough to ignite a frenzy of speculation across X (formerly Twitter).Crypto bull Anthony Pompliano suggested the move won't be minor, noting that such a decision would require substantial board-level approval. ""You don’t go through all that effort just to allocate 1%,"" Pompliano said, adding that Chairman Ryan Cohen’s online behavior signals “hardcore Bitcoiner” tendencies.How Much Bitcoin Could GameStop Buy?While exact numbers weren’t released, Michael Saylor, whose company Strategy (MSTR) has amassed over 500,000 BTC, ran a poll on X asking how much Bitcoin GameStop should hold to earn respect from Bitcoiners. The top response? At least $3 billion in BTC.Industry watchers speculated that GameStop’s war chest — boosted through creative fundraising efforts like debt issuance — positions the company to take a meaningful stake in Bitcoin, though it’s unlikely to match Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy just yet.Market Reactions: Bullish, But CautiousDespite no actual Bitcoin purchases being confirmed, GameStop’s announcement alone pushed stock prices higher. Former bond trader Josh Mandell quipped on X, “I will not ask anyone to make it make sense,” referencing the disconnect between asset ownership and price reaction.Still, if executed strategically, the move could rebrand GameStop as a Bitcoin-forward company, joining a growing list of public firms integrating digital assets into corporate treasuries.What This Means for Bitcoin & MarketsGameStop’s crypto pivot adds a new layer of mainstream credibility to Bitcoin adoption at the enterprise level, particularly as macro uncertainties and inflation concerns linger. The move may also influence other cash-heavy firms considering Bitcoin as a hedge or strategic asset.With Bitcoin nearing $87,000, institutional moves like this could further validate BTC’s position as a long-term reserve asset — potentially pushing prices higher in the coming months, according to CoinDesk.",03-26-2025

The move comes amid a surge in crypto-related legislative activity on Capitol Hill, including renewed efforts around IRS-related crypto taxation in the Senate.Key Highlights:The bill, known as the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, was introduced by Rep. Bryan Steil and Rep. French Hill, chairs of the House Financial Services Committee and its crypto subcommittee.The House version aims to align closely with the Senate’s recently approved bipartisan version, bridging prior legislative gaps.The bill governs how companies issue dollar-denominated digital tokens, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and consumer protection.Rep. Tom Emmer, a long-time crypto advocate, stated that the two versions of the bill have “minor differences” that can be resolved as the legislation progresses.Legislative Momentum:With the Senate Banking Committee having already advanced its stablecoin bill to the floor, and the House now formally entering the process, lawmakers are signaling that stablecoin regulation is a top crypto priority in 2025.Both versions of the STABLE Act focus on ensuring that issuers of stablecoins maintain sufficient reserves, provide regular disclosures, and operate under clear regulatory oversight, particularly for systemic and non-bank issuers.Expanding the Crypto Policy AgendaAlso on Wednesday, Rep. Tom Emmer reintroduced his Securities Clarity Act, a bill that seeks to define how a crypto asset might fall within the U.S. securities law framework. The bill, originally part of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT 21), was reintroduced alongside Democratic Rep. Darren Soto, signaling continued bipartisan support for regulatory clarity.Emmer, Steil, and other key lawmakers involved in shaping crypto policy appeared at the DC Blockchain Summit, a crypto policy event hosted by the Digital Chamber. During the summit, many expressed optimism that stablecoin legislation could be finalized by August.As the conference wrapped up, the Senate was preparing for a second vote on a Congressional Review Act resolution aimed at overturning the IRS’ 2024 regulation on DeFi broker reporting. While both chambers have previously passed the resolution — and President Trump is expected to sign it — Senate procedural rules require an additional vote because the House must initiate tax-related legislation.What It Means for the MarketThe synchronized momentum in both chambers of Congress boosts the likelihood of a comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework being passed this year. This legal clarity could accelerate institutional adoption of compliant stablecoins and provide structure for exchanges and developers navigating U.S. law.The renewed introduction of the Securities Clarity Act and progress on IRS DeFi regulation rollbacks highlight broader Congressional efforts to reshape how crypto fits into the traditional financial regulatory landscape.Lawmakers appear focused on building a cohesive digital asset framework that balances innovation, investor protection, and compliance — with stablecoins leading the charge, according to CoinDesk.",03-26-2025

Binance,"Amitis Capital's Chris Solarz Predicts Challenges for Altcoins
According to Odaily, Chris Solarz, Chief Investment Officer of Amitis Capital, has declared the end of the era where altcoins rise collectively. With approximately 40 million tokens in the current crypto ecosystem, Solarz anticipates that 99.99% will eventually become worthless, with fewer than 100 tokens worth discussing. He highlighted that the crypto market will require at least $300 billion in new funds over the next three years to maintain current prices, as the top 100 tokens face significant unlocking and selling pressure. The liquid token market available for hedge funds is only about $30 billion, while retail investors have shifted towards meme coins, indicating a lack of sufficient buyers to absorb the selling pressure. Solarz described this situation as a 'sword hanging overhead,' explaining why altcoins are unlikely to experience a bull market in the short term.

According to Cointelegraph, Polymarket, the leading decentralized prediction market, is facing criticism following a contentious resolution in a political betting market. The platform posed a question regarding whether U.S. President Donald Trump would agree to a rare earth mineral deal with Ukraine before April. Despite the absence of such an event, the market concluded with a ""Yes,"" sparking discontent among users and industry analysts.Concerns have been raised about a potential ""governance attack,"" where a significant stakeholder from the UMA Protocol allegedly manipulated the oracle to settle the market with incorrect results for personal gain. Crypto threat researcher Vladimir S. highlighted that this individual used 5 million tokens across three accounts, representing 25% of the total votes. Polymarket has pledged to prevent similar incidents in the future, as stated in a March 26 post by Vladimir S.Polymarket relies on UMA Protocol's blockchain oracles to obtain external data for settling market outcomes and verifying real-world events. The market in question recorded over $7 million in trading volume before its settlement on March 25. However, not all agree that the incident was a deliberate attack.

Tenadome argued that the voters involved were regular UMA participants who overlooked clarifications to secure their rewards.Despite the backlash, Polymarket moderators have stated that no refunds will be issued. Moderator Tanner acknowledged the situation, explaining that the market's resolution did not constitute a failure, thus precluding refunds.

Binance,"Senator Gillibrand Advocates for Stablecoin Regulation to Protect Banking System
According to Cointelegraph, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has called for restrictions on stablecoin issuers from offering yield-bearing opportunities, emphasizing the need to safeguard the traditional banking system. Speaking at the 2025 DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, the Democratic senator from New York highlighted the importance of adopting New York's stringent financial regulations across all financial sectors. She stressed that these regulations should apply to stablecoin issuers, regardless of whether they are regulated at the state or federal level, to ensure compliance with existing laws and protect consumer safety.Gillibrand expressed concerns about the potential impact of stablecoin issuers offering interest, suggesting it could undermine local banks' ability to provide essential services like home mortgages and small business loans. She warned that if stablecoin issuers offer interest, there would be little incentive for consumers to deposit money in local banks, which could destabilize the financial services system that many rely on. ""If there is no deposit, small banks cannot do that anymore; it will collapse the financial services system that people rely on for their businesses and mortgages,"" she stated.Gillibrand is a co-sponsor of the GENIUS stablecoin legislation, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February. This bill aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital fiat tokens. On March 10, Hagerty updated the bill to include stricter anti-money laundering provisions, know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, financial transparency regulations, and consumer protection controls. The Senate Banking Committee advanced the GENIUS bill with an 18-6 vote on March 13. The bill must pass both chambers of Congress before reaching U.S. President Donald Trump's desk for signing.Critics of the GENIUS stablecoin bill argue that it is an attempt to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States through privatized means. Jean Rausis, co-founder of the decentralized trading platform Smardex, contended that centralized stablecoins could lead to financial censorship and state surveillance, potentially allowing the government to restrict access to financial systems.

Binance,"Bitcoin Mining Stocks Decline Amid Microsoft's AI Data Center Withdrawal
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin mining stocks have experienced a downturn following reports that Microsoft has decided to halt its plans for new artificial intelligence data centers in the United States and Europe. This decision, attributed to concerns over a potential oversupply, was reported by Bloomberg and supported by data from Google Finance. The shares of several cryptocurrency mining companies, including Bitfarms, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, and Riot, saw declines ranging from 4% to 12% in response to the news.The retrenchment in stock prices underscores the growing reliance of cryptocurrency miners on business from artificial intelligence models, particularly after the Bitcoin network's halving in April 2024, which reduced mining revenues. Coin Metrics highlighted in a March report that miners are diversifying into AI data-center hosting to expand revenue and repurpose existing infrastructure for high-performance computing. Core Scientific, for instance, committed 200 megawatts of hardware capacity in June 2024 to support CoreWeave's AI workloads. Additionally, asset manager VanEck projected in August 2024 that Bitcoin mining stocks could collectively see a significant increase in market capitalizations, estimated at around $37 billion, if they invest heavily in AI support.Despite these potential gains, miners have faced challenges this year due to declining cryptocurrency prices, which have exacerbated pressures on businesses already affected by the April halving, as noted by JPMorgan in March. The diminishing demand for AI data centers could further strain these companies. Analysts at TD Cowen reported on March 26 that Microsoft had abandoned plans to construct several new data centers, which would have generated approximately 2 gigawatts of power, according to Bloomberg. This decision was attributed to a perceived oversupply of computing capacity for AI models and Microsoft's choice to forgo certain planned collaborations with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.Over the past six months, Microsoft has canceled various data center leases and postponed plans to increase capacity, as reported by Bloomberg. The tech giant's investments in data centers are anticipated to slow further in the latter half of 2025 as it completes $80 billion in planned buildouts and shifts focus to equipping existing centers with hardware and equipment. This strategic pivot reflects Microsoft's adaptation to changing market conditions and its reassessment of AI infrastructure needs.",03-26-2025

Solarz highlighted that the crypto market is still in its early stages, allowing fund managers to employ strategies reminiscent of those used during the nascent phase of traditional finance hedge funds 35 years ago.In 1990, there were only 127 hedge funds globally, managing approximately $39 billion in assets. By 2024, this number had surged to over 10,000 companies managing $5 trillion. Solarz noted that the traditional market has become highly competitive, making it increasingly difficult to outperform the market.Solarz candidly stated, ""I've interacted with 20 crypto fund managers, and 19 of them are not fit to manage money.

I question why I should pay a 20% management fee for something I could achieve through ETF allocations myself.""He believes that asymmetric opportunities will persist until crypto technology is fully integrated into the financial system.

Binance,"FDIC Removes Reputational Risk from Bank Supervision Criteria
According to ShibDaily, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has decided to eliminate 'reputational risk' from its bank supervision criteria, a move that could facilitate easier access to banking services for cryptocurrency firms. This decision follows the passage of Senator Tim Scott's Financial Integrity and Regulation Management (FIRM) Act, which aims to remove reputational risk considerations from all federal banking regulators. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee confirmed the FDIC's decision in a post on X, highlighting that the FIRM Act was approved with a 13-11 party-line vote. The legislation seeks to ensure that banks make decisions based on concrete financial and regulatory criteria rather than subjective concerns about the perception of certain clients or industries. This is particularly significant for businesses in sectors such as digital assets, firearms, and energy, which have historically faced challenges in accessing banking services due to regulatory pressures. By codifying the removal of reputational risk from banking oversight, the FIRM Act aims to promote fairness and prevent regulators from influencing banks to sever ties with lawful businesses. David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, described the FDIC's policy change as a 'big win for crypto.' He noted that the term 'reputational risk' was previously defined as the potential for negative publicity—whether accurate or not—to cause financial harm, including customer losses, legal expenses, or reduced revenue. Critics have argued that this broad and subjective standard was used to justify denying banking services to lawful cryptocurrency businesses, particularly under what has been referred to as 'Operation Chokepoint 2.0.' Many industry stakeholders have advocated for banking regulations to rely on clear, objective, and quantifiable criteria rather than speculative concerns over public perception. The FDIC's policy change aligns with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which implemented a similar measure on March 20 to remove reputational risk as a factor in banking supervision. This move, along with the OCC's earlier action, signals a broader effort to create a clearer and more consistent regulatory environment, especially for industries like cryptocurrency that have faced banking challenges in the past.

Binance,"Ripple Labs Settles with SEC, Ending Legal Dispute Over XRP
According to ShibDaily, Ripple Labs has reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), concluding a lengthy legal battle that has been closely monitored by the cryptocurrency industry. As part of the settlement, Ripple will pay a $50 million penalty and withdraw its cross-appeal. This resolution is significant in the ongoing regulatory discussions surrounding digital assets. Ripple's Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, announced the settlement on social media, marking the end of the legal dispute. The SEC will retain $50 million of the original $125 million penalty, with the remainder returned to Ripple. Alderoty noted that the SEC has agreed to drop its appeal without conditions, and Ripple has reciprocated by dropping its cross-appeal. The agency will also request the court to lift the standard injunction previously imposed at the SEC's request, pending a Commission vote and the drafting of final documents. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the SEC's decision to drop its appeal, describing it as a significant victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency sector. The legal battle began in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through the sale of its XRP token. Ripple countered these claims, arguing that XRP should not be classified as a security and criticizing the SEC's regulatory approach as lacking clarity. Throughout the case, both parties achieved partial victories. In a notable ruling in July 2023, a federal judge determined that XRP was not a security when sold on exchanges to retail investors, although institutional sales of the token did violate securities laws. This decision was viewed as a win for Ripple and the crypto industry, supporting the argument that certain digital assets should not be subject to traditional securities regulations. The settlement with the SEC is expected to have lasting implications for how regulators approach digital assets, potentially shaping the legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the United States.",03-26-2025

Binance,"Tokenized U.S. Treasury Market Surpasses $5 Billion Amid Rising Demand
According to BlockBeats, the market value of tokenized U.S. Treasury securities has exceeded $5 billion for the first time this week, marking a $1 billion increase in just two weeks. This surge is primarily driven by the tokenized Treasury fund BUIDL, launched by asset management giant BlackRock and digital asset company Securitize. Currently, the top five tokenized U.S. Treasury funds are: - BlackRock and Securitize's BUIDL: $1.702 billion - Hashnote's USYC: $765 million - Franklin Templeton's BENJI: $693 million - Ondo Finance's USDY: $594 million - Superstate's USTB: $413 million Tokenized U.S. Treasuries are at the forefront of the tokenization trend, attracting significant attention from global financial giants and digital asset companies. Fidelity Investments has recently joined the ranks of major U.S. asset management firms exploring tokenized money market funds. Last week, the company submitted an application to launch a tokenized version of a dollar money market fund on Ethereum. Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of Fidelity's digital asset management division, expressed optimism about tokenization and its transformative potential for the financial services industry, citing its ability to enhance trading efficiency through effective capital allocation across markets. Potential of Tokenized U.S. Treasuries Tokenized U.S. Treasuries allow investors to deploy idle funds on the blockchain to earn returns, functioning similarly to traditional money market funds. Additionally, tokenized Treasuries are increasingly used as reserve assets in DeFi protocols, with significant potential for use as collateral in trading and asset management activities. State Street Bank is also exploring the tokenization of bonds and money market funds. Donna Milrod, the bank's product chief, noted that collateral tokens could have mitigated the liability-driven crisis faced by UK pension funds in 2022, enabling pension funds and asset managers to meet margin requirements using money market fund tokens without liquidating assets to raise cash. Advantages and Disadvantages of Tokenized U.S. Treasuries Some may wonder why tokenized versions are necessary when traditional U.S. Treasuries are essentially the same. Here is a comparison: Disadvantages of Traditional U.S. Treasuries: - Cross-border transaction limitations: High costs and slow speeds in cross-border transactions. - Low settlement and delivery efficiency: Traditional financial transactions often require T+1 or longer settlement cycles. Advantages of Tokenized U.S. Treasuries (based on blockchain technology): - 24/7 instant settlement, significantly improving transaction efficiency. - Breaking geographical and financial institution barriers, promoting global capital flow. However, tokenized U.S. Treasuries also pose risks, such as implementing AML/KYC standards to prevent money laundering and fund misappropriation. Additionally, blockchain asset security, smart contract vulnerabilities, and potential hacking risks remain challenges the industry must overcome.",03-26-2025

Currently, Bitcoin is forming a 'high compact flag,' a technical pattern often seen as a bullish continuation signal. The report highlights that Bitcoin has already surpassed an initial downward trendline (white line) and is now testing a more significant resistance level (gray line).

Binance,"BlackRock Launches Bitcoin ETP in Europe Amid Regulatory Support
According to BlockBeats, BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, has introduced its Bitcoin Exchange Traded Product (ETP) in Europe following its success in the U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF market. The iShares Bitcoin ETP is now listed on Germany's Xetra exchange and France's Euronext Paris under the trading code IB1T, with another version, BTCN, available on Amsterdam's Euronext. To attract early investors, BlackRock is offering a limited-time zero-fee promotion, reducing the ETP fee to 0.15%, compared to the 0.25% fee for similar U.S. products. This makes it one of the most cost-effective Bitcoin ETPs in the European market, likely appealing to both retail and institutional investors seeking low-cost digital asset investments. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that while Europe has been a pioneer in cryptocurrency ETPs, with over 160 digital asset tracking products, its overall market size remains smaller compared to the U.S. Despite this, BlackRock's entry into the European market could significantly boost growth, especially if it replicates the success seen in the U.S., including improved cost efficiency and trading volume. However, not everyone is optimistic about this development. Finbold's editor, Vini Barbosa, expressed concerns about the current demand for Bitcoin, which is largely driven by centralized derivatives like futures contracts and ETFs/ETPs, with BlackRock playing a key role. Barbosa highlighted that on-chain transaction volumes are notably low, while speculative derivative trading volumes continue to rise, which he views as unfavorable for Bitcoin. The introduction of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETP in Europe aligns with the regulatory requirements of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, a comprehensive regulatory structure for the cryptocurrency market in Europe. Experts believe that the proactive stance of European financial regulators will create favorable conditions for future cryptocurrency product issuance and trading, aiding long-term market development. BlackRock's ETP could mark a new beginning for the European market. The increasing involvement of institutional investors and the gradual improvement of Europe's crypto asset regulatory environment are expected to be significant drivers for Bitcoin's future growth.",03-26-2025

Binance,"Immutable Token Surges Following SEC Investigation Closure
According to Cointelegraph, the token associated with crypto gaming leader Immutable experienced a 15% increase in value following the announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had concluded its investigation into the company without further action. On March 25, the Immutable (IMX) token rose to nearly $0.74 after the firm revealed that the SEC had closed its inquiry, effectively resolving the Wells notice issued last year. The IMX token reached its highest price since March 3, prior to a broader market downturn influenced by ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and interest rates, which had pushed the token down to $0.46 by March 11. At the time of publication, IMX had adjusted to $0.67, as reported by CoinMarketCap. A potential rise back to $0.70 could eliminate approximately $449,500 in short positions, according to CoinGlass data. Over the past 30 days, IMX has seen a modest increase of 0.34%, as noted by CoinMarketCap. Despite the positive news, the token's price remained relatively stable when Immutable disclosed in November that it had received a Wells notice. However, the broader market was already gaining traction as Trump's chances of winning the election appeared strong in the days leading up to his victory on November 5. Immutable's co-founder, Robbie Ferguson, expressed in a March 25 post on X that the SEC's decision to drop the investigation marked ""an enormous win for Web3 gaming,"" emphasizing the resolution of a threat to digital ownership rights. In the gaming crypto sector, several tokens have experienced an upswing over the past 24 hours. Gala (GALA) increased by 2.78%, The Sandbox (SAND) rose by 3.78%, FLOKI (FLOKI) climbed by 1.91%, and Axie Infinity (AXS) advanced by 1.50%. IMX reached its all-time high of $9.32 in November 2021 during a significant rally in gaming tokens. Speculation continues regarding when gaming tokens might experience another substantial uptrend, as historically, they have surged following broader crypto market movements. However, over the past 30 days, the total market capitalization of gaming tokens has decreased by 3.65% to $13.13 billion, while trading volume has suffered a more significant decline, dropping 33.45% to $1.75 billion.

Binance,"Celo Completes Transition to Ethereum Layer-2 Chain
According to CoinDesk, the Celo blockchain has successfully transitioned to an Ethereum layer-2 chain, concluding a nearly two-year process. This significant development marks the end of a journey that began in July 2023, involving a community vote in July 2024 and a competitive selection process won by Optimism. The transition enhances the network by offering faster and cheaper transactions on Ethereum's mainnet, powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable framework for building layer-2 networks. Marek Olszewski, CEO of cLabs, the main developer firm supporting Celo, praised the OP Stack, stating, ""Whenever people ask us, we always recommend the OP stack, because the team there has been so helpful and so supportive."" This migration is considered a pioneering move within the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially serving as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains aiming to become layer-2 networks. Rene Reisberg, CEO of the Celo Foundation, emphasized the importance of maintaining historical data during the transition, making it a valuable case study for Ethereum. Despite challenges faced by Ethereum leaders, including community backlash and competition from other blockchains like Solana, Reinsberg noted that similar layer-1 networks are observing Celo's transition and contemplating their own moves into the layer-2 ecosystem. ""As some of these short-term storms come down and sentiment starts to shift, I think you'll start seeing a series of layer 1s that will likely be more public about that,"" Reisberg commented, highlighting the growing interest in such transitions. For Celo end users, the transition will not significantly alter their experience, as they will continue to access key features like SocialConnect, which links phone numbers or X handles to Celo wallet addresses for payments. However, there are notable protocol-level changes. Validator responsibilities have shifted from operating the consensus protocol to temporarily running community RPC nodes, with rewards now distributed via smart contract execution. Transaction sequencing, previously managed by validators, will initially be handled by a centralized sequencer, with plans for future decentralization. This strategic move positions Celo within the evolving landscape of Ethereum layer-2 solutions.",03-26-2025

Binance,"DeFi's Role in Transforming Traditional Finance: A Paradigm Shift
According to PANews, a recent survey conducted among 300 traditional finance (TradFi) professionals across various institutions, positions, and regions reveals a consensus that the current financial system's inefficiencies hinder economic growth and lead to resource wastage. The survey highlights decentralized finance (DeFi) as a potential solution to these challenges, emphasizing its role in reducing redundancy and unlocking real value. The report suggests that DeFi is not merely an alternative but the future direction for traditional finance, contingent on supportive policy development. The survey's findings indicate that over two-thirds of traditional financial companies are actively exploring DeFi. The existing technological infrastructure in TradFi is labor-intensive and requires significant manual operations, prompting many companies to seek advanced technologies to reduce costs, improve risk management, and enhance operational efficiency. Nearly 90% of these companies are investing in or researching the benefits of public blockchain technology, viewing DeFi as a key to solving operational efficiency issues. Data from the survey also shows that TradFi sees DeFi as an integral part of its core business operations. This perspective stems from a belief in DeFi's potential to improve the financial system. TradFi's view of DeFi has evolved from skepticism to acceptance, recognizing it as an inevitable trend and a significant opportunity. Furthermore, the survey reveals that traditional finance rejects private blockchains as alternatives to public, permissionless blockchains. Previous research indicated that central banks are moving away from proprietary blockchains in favor of open-source software and public networks. The current survey reinforces that the TradFi community views public blockchains as crucial for technologies like smart contracts and asset tokenization. Stablecoins, asset tokenization, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are identified as key areas of interest for TradFi, aligning with the growing trend of on-chain transaction volumes in these sectors. These three pillars are essential for accelerating market development by providing settlement assets, universal asset representation, and composable protocols for on-chain financial transactions. Growth in these areas is expected to continue in the coming years. However, the regulatory environment poses the greatest obstacle to DeFi's short-term economic efficiency. Policymakers face a generational opportunity to accelerate change. TradFi acknowledges DeFi's inevitable development and its significant improvements over many existing financial systems. The main barrier to TradFi's full embrace of crypto technology is not infrastructure or practicality but regulatory restrictions. These restrictions have delayed the integration of DeFi into traditional finance. As the cautious observation period ends, it is time for regulators to remove barriers between TradFi and DeFi, allowing traditional financial institutions to embrace this revolutionary technology.",03-26-2025

Binance,"Bitcoin Faces Potential Pullback as Whale Activity Increases
According to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin traders have shown optimism as the cryptocurrency's price surged to the $88,000 mark. However, the inability to surpass this level in the short term might signal a take-profit opportunity. Alphractal, a crypto analytics platform, observed that significant Bitcoin holders, known as whales, have initiated short positions at this price point. In a recent post on X, Alphractal highlighted a notable shift in the 'Whale Position Sentiment' metric, suggesting that major market players with a bearish outlook are influencing the market. This metric assesses the relationship between aggregated open interest and trades exceeding $1 million across various exchanges. Alphractal's CEO, Joao Wedson, confirmed that whales have closed their long positions, historically aligning price movements with their market bias. CryptoQuant's data further supports this bearish sentiment, with 8 out of 10 onchain signals indicating a potential downturn, except for stablecoin liquidity and technical signal indicators. Last week, CryptoQuant's CEO, Ki Young Ju, warned of a possible bear market, advising investors to brace for 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action. Despite these indicators, some investors remain confident in Bitcoin's prospects. Data from IntoTheBlock revealed net Bitcoin outflows of $220 million from exchanges in the past 24 hours, totaling $424 million between March 18 and March 24. This trend suggests that certain holders are accumulating Bitcoin, even as onchain metrics flash red. On a lower time frame chart, Bitcoin reached an intraday high of $88,752 on March 24 but has not established a new high since. The cryptocurrency is currently moving within an ascending channel pattern, facing resistance from the upper range and the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages on the daily chart. For Bitcoin to continue its rally towards $100,000, it must close above the $90,000 mark, especially with whales potentially shorting between $88,000 and $90,000.

The announcement, made on March 25, stated that the suspension of financial compensation in the form of cryptocurrency, specifically Worldcoin (WLD), or any other format, will remain in effect for any World ID created by collecting iris scans of personal data subjects in Brazil. Tools For Humanity faces a daily fine of 50,000 Brazilian reais ($8,800) if it resumes data collection activities. The World ID verification process in Brazil was short-lived, as the ANDP halted data collection just over two months after its launch in the country. The investigation into World, previously known as Worldcoin, began in November of the previous year amid concerns that financial incentives might undermine users' ability to consent to sharing sensitive biometric data. The World ID, a controversial digital passport created through iris scans, aims to authenticate humans online. Despite the legal challenges in Brazil, the demand for digital identification solutions is increasing in other markets, driven by the rise of AI deepfakes and Sybil attacks. The proliferation of bots and AI is also affecting online discourse on social media platforms like X and Facebook, with reports suggesting that up to 15% of X accounts may be bots. Research from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis indicates that generative AI is enhancing the profitability of crypto scams by facilitating the creation of fake identities. In response to privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny, some companies are developing digital identity solutions that do not rely on biometric data. Earlier this year, Billions Network introduced a digital identity platform based on zero-knowledge verification technology known as Circom, which has been tested by major financial institutions such as HSBC and Deutsche Bank. This approach aims to provide secure digital identity solutions without compromising user privacy.",03-25-2025

The proposal involves cooperation among the SEC, Japan's Financial Services Agency (JFSA), Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ).

Binance,"XRP Faces Bearish Indicators Despite SEC Case Resolution
According to CoinDesk, the recent resolution of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) case against Ripple has sparked excitement among XRP enthusiasts. Ripple, which uses XRP for cross-border transactions, saw the case's conclusion as a significant relief, potentially paving the way for improved performance. The legal battle had previously hindered XRP during the 2021 bull run. Additionally, there is growing anticipation around the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and hopes that the token might become part of the U.S. strategic reserve. Despite this optimism, XRP's recent price action has not mirrored the enthusiasm. The token remains rangebound between $2.30 and $2.50, with key momentum indicators suggesting a potential bearish trend shift. Last Wednesday, XRP surged over 11% to $2.59 following the SEC news. However, the subsequent price movement has been less bullish, even as expectations rise that U.S. President Donald Trump's anticipated reciprocal trade tariffs on April 2 might be more moderate than initially feared. The three-line break chart, a tool that filters out short-term noise to identify trend changes, is signaling a bearish trend reversal for XRP. This chart, which aggregates price information over a week, has shown a new red bar early this month, indicating a bearish momentum shift. Such patterns have previously marked the onset of prolonged bear markets in 2021 and early 2018. Further reinforcing the bearish outlook, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is showing deeper bars below the zero line on the weekly chart, indicating strengthening downside momentum. The MACD flipped positive in November, leading to a price surge from $1 to above $3. However, the 5- and 10-week simple moving averages (SMAs) have crossed bearishly, suggesting that the path of least resistance is downward. Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure volatility, have widened following a sharp price rally in late 2024 and early 2025. Historically, such widening has preceded price declines, as seen after mid-2021 and early 2018. For a bullish outlook to re-emerge, XRP would need to firmly move to $3, negating the current lower highs pattern. Some analysts remain optimistic, predicting that XRP could reach as high as $10 by the end of the decade.",03-25-2025

Binance,"Strategy Expands Financial Offerings with New Preferred Stock
According to CoinDesk, Strategy (MSTR), a U.S. company known for its significant investments in bitcoin (BTC), has broadened its financial strategies by introducing a second Series A perpetual preferred stock. This new offering, named Strife (STRF), is part of the company's expanding capital market instruments. The company is selling 8.5 million shares of STRF at $85 each, aiming to raise a net $711.2 million for further bitcoin acquisitions, surpassing its initial target of $500 million. The sale is set to conclude later on Tuesday. Previously, Strategy's first preferred issuance, Strike (STRK), raised $563 million. Perpetual preferred stocks like STRF are positioned between debt and common equity in the capital structure, typically providing dividends and greater price stability, which appeals to investors seeking lower volatility and predictable returns. Unlike common stockholders, preferred stockholders do not have voting rights. STRF offers a 10% annual dividend on a $100 stated amount, with quarterly cash payments. If Strategy misses a dividend payment, the amount compounds at an additional 1% annually, up to a maximum 18% dividend rate, incentivizing timely payments. Strategy retains the option to redeem all STRF shares if less than 25% of the original issuance remains or under specific tax events, in which case shareholders would receive the liquidation preference plus any unpaid dividends. Additionally, in the event of a ""fundamental change,"" holders can compel the company to repurchase their shares at the stated amount plus any accrued dividends. In contrast, STRK offers an 8% annual dividend based on its $100 liquidation preference, though the effective yield decreases as STRK’s price increases. Unlike STRF, STRK includes a conversion feature, allowing holders to convert their preferred shares into common stock at a 10:1 ratio if the common share price reaches $1,000, providing potential equity upside. This makes STRF more akin to a fixed-income security, appealing to those prioritizing income and capital stability. To support these dividend payments, Strategy plans to utilize a combination of operational cash flow, proceeds from convertible debt offerings, and at-the-market (ATM) share sales on the common stock. Strategy also maintains an open ATM program for STRK, having recently purchased 130 BTC, with approximately $3.57 billion remaining on its ATM capacity through common stock. This provides significant flexibility to fund dividend commitments while continuing its bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company's shares increased by over 10% on Monday, with Strategy holding 506,137 BTC at that time.",03-25-2025

According to BlockBeats, Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. has stated that current on-chain indicators suggest the price cycle reflects healthy consolidation rather than the onset of a bear market. Adler Jr. highlighted that Bitcoin has not yet entered the 'overheated' zone in this cycle, as evidenced by the investor price model.This model, which combines realized market value, investor price, and Bitcoin supply data, issued sell signals twice in 2021. Using the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD) indicator, Adler believes the market remains in a 'growth phase.'The CVDD indicator monitors the selling activity of long-term holders. In the current bull market, a sell signal was triggered only once in March 2024. In a Substack article, Adler noted, 'Considering the current market dynamics, once Bitcoin surpasses the critical peak level of $123,000, there could be profit-taking by seasoned investors, exerting downward pressure on the price.'Based on this analysis, Adler Jr. predicts that Bitcoin could rise to $130,000 within 90 days.",03-25-2025

Binance,"Arizona Advances Digital Asset Reserve Bills Amid Political Challenges
According to Cointelegraph, two significant digital asset reserve bills in Arizona have successfully passed the House Rules Committee and are now set for a full vote on the House floor. These bills, if enacted, would enable Arizona to create strategic digital asset reserves using assets seized from criminal activities and newly invested public funds. With Republicans holding a 33-27 majority in the Arizona House of Representatives, the bills have a favorable chance of passing. However, the final challenge may come from the state's Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, who has a history of vetoing legislation, having blocked 22% of bills in 2024, the highest rate among state governors. The two bills in question are the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) and the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025). SB 1373 aims to establish a reserve of digital assets seized through criminal proceedings, managed by the state treasurer. The treasurer would be restricted to investing no more than 10% of the fund's total value each fiscal year, with the option to loan assets to enhance returns without increasing financial risks. SB 1025 focuses on Bitcoin, proposing that Arizona's Treasury and state retirement system invest up to 10% of available funds into Bitcoin. It also suggests storing the state's Bitcoin reserve in a secure, segregated account within a federal Bitcoin reserve, should one be established. Arizona is at the forefront of establishing a state-based digital asset reserve, with other states closely following. On March 6, the Texas Senate passed its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB-21) with a 25-5 vote. This bill still requires approval from the House and the governor's signature to become law. Following this, Democrat Representative Ron Reynolds introduced a new bill to cap the previously uncapped reserve at $250 million. Utah also passed Bitcoin legislation, but references to a strategic reserve were removed at the last moment. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma House passed its Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB1203 with a 77-15 vote on March 25, which will now proceed to the state Senate.",03-25-2025

According to BlockBeats, Morgan Stanley analysts reported that the Federal Reserve is close to ending its historic streak of losses and may soon resume returning cash to the U.S. Treasury. This development is linked to the Fed's financial operations and its payments to maintain control over short-term interest rates. The aggressive rate hikes that began three years ago led to significant losses for the Fed, but with the recent decline in short-term rates, Morgan Stanley suggests the Fed is nearing a critical point for profitability. Morgan Stanley estimates that the Fed's breakeven interest rate is approximately 4.8%. The combination of a shrinking balance sheet and lower policy rates is helping the Fed move away from losses. Analysts indicate that the continued reduction in bond holdings and the potential for further rate cuts ""suggests the Fed will return to profitability."" The Federal Reserve released its 2024 financial status last Friday, revealing a total net loss of $77.5 billion for 2024, following a record deficit of $114.6 billion in 2023.

Binance,"Nostra Halts Borrowing for Liquid Staking Tokens Amid Price Feed Issue
According to Cointelegraph, Nostra, a lending protocol on Starknet, has temporarily suspended borrowing for two liquid staking tokens due to a critical issue with its price feeds. On March 24, Nostra identified errors in its price feed that inflated the reported prices of xSTRK and sSTRK, two liquid staking derivatives of Starknet's native STRK token, to nearly three times their actual value. This discrepancy could have led to unnecessary liquidations of otherwise secure positions, potentially affecting users with healthy positions. In response to the issue, Nostra has disabled further borrowing against xSTRK and sSTRK collateral deposits. The protocol has advised users with existing deposits of these tokens to withdraw their collateral immediately. Nostra acknowledged the absence of a secondary oracle to support these assets, which limits their ability to prevent similar incidents in the future. The protocol emphasized its commitment to safeguarding user funds, stating that without a fallback oracle, the risks outweigh the benefits. Starknet, a layer-2 scaling chain of Ethereum secured by zero-knowledge proofs, launched its mainnet in late 2021. It currently has a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $575 million, according to data from L2Beat. Nostra, one of the larger DeFi projects on Starknet, has a TVL of around $55 million. The protocol allows users to post collateral in one token to borrow another, with popular collateral options including Ether, STRK, and stablecoins like USDC and Tether. STRK is designed to be staked in exchange for a portion of the network's fee revenues.

According to Odaily, CoinReg Tech, a provider of regulatory technology for the digital asset market, has submitted recommendations to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through its cryptocurrency task force. The proposals focus on several key areas of regulation for digital asset securities. Firstly, CoinReg Tech suggests that digital asset securities trading, whether conducted 'on-chain' or 'off-chain,' should adhere to the same transaction reporting requirements as standard securities. This measure aims to ensure transparency and consistency in the reporting of digital asset transactions. Secondly, the company highlights the need to address investor protection and market structure issues arising from off-chain transactions facilitated by trading platforms. This includes ensuring that investors are adequately protected and that the market operates efficiently and fairly. Additionally, CoinReg Tech recommends amending the rules of the Securities Exchange Act to mandate timely reporting of all transactions considered to be digital asset securities. This would enhance the visibility and traceability of such transactions, contributing to a more robust regulatory framework. Finally, the proposal calls for joint authorization and regulation of Digital Asset Repository Transactions (DART) by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This would involve recording transactions, including those submitted to public ledgers and off-chain transactions, as well as related customer ownership, regardless of whether the digital assets are classified as 'securities' or 'commodities.'

This centralized platform would serve as an authoritative source for all digital asset securities transactions, helping regulators monitor market activity more effectively.Market Structure & Investor Protection NormsThe framework will include updated norms for market structure, including potential amendments to the Securities Exchange Act, to address the fast-evolving digital asset space.Establishment of a Presidential Working GroupIn line with this initiative, the SEC supports the creation of a new Presidential Cryptocurrency Task Force, aimed at coordinating federal agencies, streamlining regulation, and reinforcing consumer protection in the crypto ecosystem.

According to Cointelegraph, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is facing internal division over its decision to sue Elon Musk for alleged securities violations related to his acquisition of Twitter stocks. The SEC's five commissioners reportedly voted on whether to proceed with legal action against Musk, with four commissioners supporting the lawsuit and one dissenting. Mark Uyeda, appointed as acting chair by U.S. President Donald Trump, was the sole commissioner to vote against the lawsuit. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce joined three other commissioners in favor of suing Musk. The lawsuit stems from Musk's purchase of Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, which he subsequently rebranded as X. The SEC has been investigating Musk's compliance with securities laws during this acquisition. The agency filed the lawsuit on January 14, alleging that Musk failed to disclose his purchase of Twitter shares within the required 10-day period after exceeding the 5% ownership threshold. The SEC claims Musk delayed the disclosure by 11 days, allowing him to acquire shares at lower prices and save approximately $150 million. In response to the lawsuit, Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, criticized the SEC's actions, suggesting they indicate an inability to present a substantial case. Musk himself has publicly condemned the SEC, labeling it a ""totally broken organization"" on X and accusing it of neglecting to address ""actual crimes.""

Binance,"SEC's Acting Chair Calls for Clearer Crypto Regulatory Guidance
According to ShibDaily, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Acting Chair, Mark Uyeda, highlighted the ongoing legal uncertainty surrounding crypto securities laws, emphasizing the necessity for clearer regulatory guidance. During the inaugural roundtable of the SEC's Crypto Task Force, Uyeda addressed the challenges in classifying crypto assets under federal securities laws. He stressed the importance of providing clearer guidance to market participants and suggested that the SEC should consider rule-making instead of relying solely on enforcement actions to define the legal status of cryptocurrencies. Uyeda acknowledged that since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, there has been ongoing debate among regulators, market participants, and courts regarding whether crypto assets meet the legal definition of investment contracts. The Howey Test, a Supreme Court ruling from 1946, is the primary legal standard used to determine what qualifies as a security. However, conflicting court rulings on the application of the Howey Test to crypto assets have created uncertainty for investors and companies. ""Seventeen years later, market participants, lawyers, academics, policymakers, and regulators are still grappling with critical questions related to the status of these novel crypto assets under the federal securities laws,"" Uyeda stated. He further noted that appellate courts have issued conflicting rulings on key aspects of the decision, highlighting the legal uncertainty surrounding its interpretation. Uyeda pointed out that courts differ in their interpretation of investor reliance, with some requiring all investors' success to depend on the promoter's expertise, while others consider it sufficient if an investor's financial outcome is tied to the efforts of the promoter or third parties. Additionally, appellate courts remain divided on whether an investment contract necessitates ongoing efforts from the promoter after a sale or if substantial managerial actions taken before the purchase are enough to meet the legal threshold. Despite these differing interpretations, Uyeda emphasized that such legal disagreements are not unprecedented, noting that ""a judicial opinion is limited to the particular facts and circumstances of that case."" He added that when judicial opinions have created uncertainty for market participants in the past, the Commission and its staff have stepped in to provide guidance.",03-24-2025
Binance,"Russia Proposes Crypto Ban with Penalties for Unauthorized Transactions
According to ShibDaily, Russia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has announced plans to implement a ban on cryptocurrency transactions between residents unless conducted within Russia’s experimental legal framework. Nabiullina emphasized the necessity of imposing penalties on those who circumvent the proposed ban. She stated that consequences should be enforced for individuals or entities using digital assets as a means of payment outside the approved legal framework. The Bank of Russia maintains its stance that cryptocurrencies should not be permitted as a means of payment, proposing a ban on settlements in cryptocurrencies between residents outside the Experimental Legal Regime (EPR). Furthermore, the Bank of Russia suggested that cryptocurrency investments, which carry heightened risks, should be tested within an experimental framework to establish standards, improve transparency, and assess investor qualification criteria. Previously, the Central Bank’s head stated that it was time to advance Russia’s approach to cryptocurrencies. Nabiullina emphasized the need for a regulatory framework that would allow ""particularly qualified"" investors to participate in the Russian crypto market. Additionally, Vladimir Chistyukhin, First Deputy Chairman of the Bank of Russia, warned about the dangers of cryptocurrency transactions, describing them as an ""extremely risky activity"" and asserting that unqualified investors ""must be protected from it as much as possible."" In early March, Russia’s Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank initiated discussions on permitting cryptocurrency trading within the Experimental Legal Regime (ELR). These discussions focused on limiting participation to ""super-qualified"" investors, who meet stringent criteria for financial expertise and risk tolerance. The ""super-qualified"" investor category will be accessible to both professional market participants and individuals, rather than being restricted to banks. To qualify, applicants must meet strict criteria that align with existing financial market qualification standards. Currently, qualified investors must have a minimum financial threshold of 12 million rubles, which will increase to 24 million rubles starting January 1 of next year.",03-24-2025
Binance,"Pakistan Explores Bitcoin Mining to Boost Economic Growth
According to ShibDaily, the CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, Bilal Bin Saqib, has proposed utilizing the country's surplus energy for Bitcoin mining, suggesting that this untapped resource could drive economic development. Saqib presented this idea during the council's inaugural meeting on March 21, highlighting the potential advantages of incorporating cryptocurrency mining into Pakistan's energy framework. The initiative seeks to establish clear guidelines for cryptocurrency operations, aiming to attract both local and international investors to Pakistan's burgeoning digital economy. The meeting was attended by prominent figures, including lawmakers, the Governor of the Bank of Pakistan, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and the Federal IT Secretary. Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, speaking at the event, stated, ""This is the beginning of a new digital chapter for our economy. We are committed to building a transparent, future-ready financial ecosystem that attracts investment, empowers our youth, and puts Pakistan on the global map as a leader in emerging technologies."" The formation of the Crypto Council represents a significant policy shift, moving away from the government's previous resistance to digital assets. In May 2023, then-Minister of State for Finance and Revenue, Aisha Ghaus Pasha, had declared that Pakistan had no intentions to legalize cryptocurrencies, citing concerns over anti-money laundering regulations and the country's obligations to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). However, Pakistan's stance on cryptocurrencies has undergone a substantial transformation, partly influenced by the U.S. presidential elections. On November 4, 2024, the government made a pivotal decision by introducing regulations to recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender through amendments to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Act. These changes would empower the central bank to issue and regulate digital currencies, marking a significant departure from its earlier position. The proposed framework aims to formalize the use, trading, and management of virtual assets within the country, ensuring that digital currencies are backed by the Pakistani Rupee. This regulatory initiative is viewed as a step towards attracting global investment and fostering a structured crypto ecosystem in Pakistan.",03-24-2025

Binance,"Crypto News: Tokenized US Gold Reserves Could Drive Bitcoin Awareness, Says NYDIG
A move to put U.S. gold reserves on the blockchain could ultimately benefit Bitcoin, despite the fundamental differences between the two assets, according to Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG).In a research note published on March 21, Cipolaro weighed in on proposals by Trump administration officials and Elon Musk to use blockchain technology for tracking U.S. gold holdings and government spending. While Cipolaro acknowledged that such a system would still rely heavily on centralized entities—unlike Bitcoin’s decentralized and trustless model—he argued that increased blockchain use could inadvertently benefit the leading cryptocurrency.“Tokenizing gold reserves doesn’t replace Bitcoin. It may not even solve trust. But it raises awareness—and that helps Bitcoin,” said Cipolaro.He explained that blockchains are inherently limited in what they can represent. “Bitcoin has no idea what the price of Bitcoin is or even the current time,” he noted, emphasizing that systems tracking physical assets like gold would still depend on intermediaries for accuracy and validation.Political Push for Transparency at Fort KnoxThe renewed interest in auditing the U.S. gold reserves gained momentum after Republican Senator Rand Paul called for a deeper investigation into the nation’s gold holdings at Fort Knox. The move aligns with Trump and Musk’s long-standing skepticism regarding whether all the gold is truly present—a conspiracy theory that has persisted for decades.While the U.S. Mint publishes monthly reports and claims that Fort Knox undergoes annual audits, independent inspections have been rare. The vault was last opened to outsiders in 2017 for then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and before that in 1974.Not a Threat, But a Complement to CryptoCipolaro stressed that efforts to tokenize gold are not a threat to Bitcoin. Instead, they may act as a bridge to crypto awareness. “Unlike tokenized gold, Bitcoin eliminates the need for trust. But blockchain-based transparency initiatives can still draw public attention to decentralized alternatives,” he said.As gold tokenization discussions resurface, NYDIG believes the increasing intersection between traditional assets and blockchain may push more users to explore Bitcoin’s unique value proposition—particularly its role as a non-sovereign store of value, according to Cointelegraph.",03-24-2025

According to Cointelegraph, a proposal to tokenize or track U.S. gold reserves using blockchain technology has sparked discussions about transparency and trust. Greg Cipolaro, the global head of research at New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG), highlighted in a March 21 note that officials from the Trump administration, including Elon Musk, have considered using blockchain to monitor U.S. gold and government expenditures. This idea has garnered support from cryptocurrency executives. Cipolaro pointed out that while blockchains are limited in the information they convey, such as Bitcoin's inability to know its own price or the current time, the tokenization or tracking of gold reserves on a blockchain could enhance audits and transparency. However, he emphasized that this approach would still depend on trust and coordination with central entities, unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to eliminate centralized control. Cipolaro further noted that the concepts of tokenization and blockchain tracking are not in competition with the cryptocurrency market and could potentially raise awareness, ultimately benefiting Bitcoin. This discussion arises amid calls for an independent audit of the United States' gold reserves. Last month, Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to urge Musk's federal cost-cutting initiative to examine the U.S. government's gold holdings at the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, which the U.S. Mint claims contains about half of the nation's gold. Although the Treasury conducts audits and publishes reports on gold holdings at Fort Knox and other locations across the U.S. monthly, U.S. President Donald Trump and Musk have echoed long-standing conspiracy theories about the gold's presence, questioning whether it remains intact. Both Trump and Musk have advocated for an independent audit of Fort Knox. The vaults were last opened in 2017 for Trump's then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to inspect the gold, and prior to that, in 1974 for a congressional delegation and a group of journalists. The Mint's website states that no gold has entered or exited Fort Knox ""for many years,"" except for ""very small quantities"" used to test the gold's purity during audits. Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, affirmed last month that Fort Knox is audited annually and assured that ""all the gold is present and accounted for.""",03-24-2025
Binance,"Evolving Narratives in AI and Crypto: Challenges and Opportunities
According to PANews, discussions with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists reveal a steadfast belief in the potential of the AI and crypto sectors, despite some confusion surrounding the evolution of web3 AI Agent narratives. Several potential shifts in AI narratives have been identified for consideration: Firstly, the trend of issuing tokens through AI Agents as a meme has lost its appeal. Projects lacking a product-market fit and relying solely on tokenomics are often dismissed as mere speculative ventures, with little connection to AI. Secondly, the traditional implementation sequence of AI Agent, AI Framework, AI Platform, and AI DePIN might be disrupted. As the AI Agent market bubble bursts, these agents may become carriers for refined models and data algorithms. Without core technological support, AI Agents alone may struggle to demonstrate their capabilities. Thirdly, projects focused on AI data, computing power, and algorithms are likely to gain more attention than AI Agents. New AI Agents developed by these platform projects may have greater market credibility, as the teams behind AI platforms generally possess more reliable technical foundations than those deploying low-cost frameworks. Fourthly, web3 AI Agents must differentiate themselves from web2 counterparts. While web2 Agents emphasize utility and low-cost deployment, web3 Agents should focus on tokenomics. Overemphasizing low-cost deployment could lead to asset bubbles. Web3 AI Agents should innovate by integrating blockchain's distributed consensus architecture. Fifthly, the primary advantage of AI Agents is their 'application-first' approach, following a 'fat protocol, thin application' logic. The challenge lies in enhancing protocols to leverage idle computing resources and drive low-cost algorithm applications in vertical sectors like finance, healthcare, and education. Applications should gradually evolve to manage assets autonomously, engage in self-directed transactions, and facilitate multimodal interactions. Lastly, web2 protocols like MCP and Manus's automated multimodal execution offer insights for web3 innovation. Extending these protocols for web3 applications or enhancing them with distributed collaboration frameworks can be beneficial. Rather than aiming for total disruption, optimizing existing product protocols to highlight web3's unique advantages is sufficient. Both web2 and web3 are part of the ongoing AI LLMs revolution, where ideological differences are secondary to advancing AI technology.",03-24-2025

Binance,"UK Urged to Tax Crypto to Encourage Investment in Local Stocks
According to Cointelegraph, the United Kingdom is being advised to implement taxes on cryptocurrency purchases to encourage citizens to invest in local stocks, a move that could potentially bolster the nation's economy. Lisa Gordon, chair of investment bank Cavendish, expressed concerns over the growing trend of younger Britons investing in cryptocurrencies rather than equities. In a report by The Times on March 23, Gordon stated, ""It should terrify all of us that over half of under-45s own crypto and no equities."" She suggested that reducing stamp duty on equities while applying it to cryptocurrencies could redirect investments towards local companies. Currently, the UK imposes a 0.5% tax on shares listed on the London Stock Exchange, generating approximately 3 billion British pounds ($3.9 billion) annually in tax revenue. Gordon believes that cutting this tax could incentivize individuals to invest their savings in local company shares, potentially encouraging more firms to go public in the UK and stimulating economic growth. She criticized cryptocurrencies as ""non-productive assets"" that do not contribute to the economy, contrasting them with equities that provide growth capital to companies, create jobs, and generate corporate tax revenue. This, she argued, forms a social contract that should be advocated. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) reported in November that cryptocurrency ownership in the UK had risen to 12% of adults, equating to around 7 million people, with a significant portion under the age of 55. Gordon noted a shift towards saving rather than investing, which she argued is insufficient for securing a viable retirement. A 2022 FCA survey revealed that while 70% of adults had a savings account, only 38% held shares directly or through tax-advantaged accounts. Furthermore, a follow-up survey indicated that the cost of living crisis led 44% of adults to either stop or reduce saving or investing, with nearly a quarter using savings or selling investments to cover daily expenses. Gordon is part of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce, a group of industry leaders aiming to rejuvenate the local market, which would benefit Cavendish as it advises companies on potential public offerings. Consulting firm EY reported that the London stock market experienced one of its quietest years on record, with only 18 companies listing in the previous year, down from 23 in 2023. Additionally, 88 companies delisted or transferred from the exchange, citing declining liquidity and lower valuations compared to other markets like the US. Despite these challenges, Gordon asserted that the UK remains a ""safe haven"" compared to the US, which has faced significant stock market losses due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and recession fears. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has also faced downturns, with Bitcoin struggling to maintain support above $85,000, although it saw a slight increase of 2% in the past 24 hours, trading around $85,640.",03-24-2025

Binance,"Fidelity Investments Moves to Tokenize Money Market Fund on Ethereum
According to Cointelegraph, Fidelity Investments has taken a significant step in the blockchain tokenization space by filing to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on the Ethereum network. This move aligns Fidelity with other major asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, who have also ventured into blockchain tokenization. The filing, submitted on March 21 to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, outlines plans for a new share class named 'OnChain.' This initiative is designed to enhance transparency and provide verifiable tracking of share transactions for the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), an $80 million fund primarily composed of US Treasury bills. While the OnChain share class awaits regulatory approval, Fidelity anticipates its implementation by May 30. Despite the innovative approach, Fidelity will continue to maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. The secondary recording of the OnChain class on the blockchain will not serve as the official record of ownership. Instead, the transfer agent will reconcile these blockchain transactions with the official records on a daily basis. Fidelity has clarified that the US Treasury bills themselves will not be directly tokenized. The asset manager, which oversees $5.8 trillion, has indicated potential plans to expand OnChain to other blockchains in the future. The trend of asset managers turning to blockchain for tokenizing Treasury bills, bonds, and private credit has been growing over recent years. The market for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization of Treasury products is currently valued at $4.78 billion, with BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) leading at $1.46 billion, as reported by rwa.xyz. Ethereum remains the dominant network for tokenized RWAs, with over $3.3 billion worth of assets, followed by Stellar at $465.6 million. Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of crypto, emphasized Ethereum's role as the 'natural default answer' for traditional finance firms seeking to tokenize RWAs onchain. He highlighted the value clients place on decentralization, credibility, and security, which are key advantages of Ethereum. Mitchnick shared these insights at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 20, underscoring Ethereum's continued prominence in the blockchain space.",03-24-2025

Binance,"Ethereum's Potential Rebound Amid Institutional Confidence
According to Cointelegraph, Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has experienced a significant decline in value over the past three months, dropping from $4,100 in December 2024 to approximately $1,750 in March 2025. Despite this downturn, Ether is now positioned for a potential price rebound. From a technical perspective, Ether's price is approaching a breakout as it retests a long-term support zone. Historically, rebounds from this multi-year support have resulted in substantial rallies, with past cycles witnessing gains exceeding 2,000% and 360%. As of March 23, the ETH/USD pair was trading near $2,000, close to the critical support area. A successful bounce from this zone could propel the price towards $3,400 by June, marking a 65% increase from current levels. This target aligns with the lower boundary of Ether's prevailing descending channel resistance. However, a decline below the support zone might push the ETH price towards the 200-2W exponential moving average (EMA) at around $1,560. Ether's optimistic outlook is further supported by growing institutional confidence in Ethereum. BlackRock's BUIDL fund now holds approximately $1.145 billion worth of Ether, an increase from around $990 million a week ago, as reported by Token Terminal. The fund primarily focuses on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), with Ethereum serving as the dominant base layer. While the fund diversifies across various chains such as Avalanche, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum, and Optimism, Ethereum remains its core allocation. BlackRock's recent acquisition of ETH highlights rising institutional confidence in Ethereum's role as the leading platform for real-world asset tokenization. Additionally, Ethereum's bullish case is supported by a notable increase in whale accumulation. Recent on-chain data from Nansen indicates that since March 12, 2024, addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have increased their holdings by 5.65%, while those holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have risen by 28.73%. Although addresses with more than 100,000 ETH remain relatively stable, this accumulation trend underscores growing conviction among large investors.
